Sarkarsherin,R2BT60BZIDC986R17KDJGM0QOT3PR2U9CP6B4FEVBNRJ29G3M313IFR,"4,6",4,2886,2,the only ANDROID tablet that makes sense in the nonsense tab market of IndiaAn impressive tablet for Android at lastAll good but miner bugs just dont upgrade it to 1306 New update details givengood tablet,first i would like to comment on the tab market of India the most peculiar thing I have seen in India is when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the USA you watch the prices of chromebooks tablets back to school offers in the US and compare them to India and it feels extremely unbalanced after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier 1 brands started delivering garbage for 20000 rupees snapdragon 400 old mediatek 4gb ram abysmal non ips screen for 20k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students THIS TABLET BRINGS THE REVOLUTIONI am no student but bought this for day to day use and I am an user of the normal big bezel 7th gen iPad so my review will be comparative in nature also i bought this at 23000 rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price I paid1 if you are planning to buy an iPad just buy it considering 64gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updatesthis tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad FOR 23K RUPEES even for 27k it is fine2 build is fine although I put a tempered glass on the 1st day itself back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy3 the IPS screen is really good there is no backlight bleeding no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background I am used to OLED screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but OLED is impossible at this price the screen is better than my 7th gen iPads display it is brighter has more punchy colours blacks are darker on top of that 120hz panel hdr certification dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet4 snapdragon 860 is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market hence I say if you dont want this just buy an iPad but dont buy any other android tablet at 2030k price point all are trash 860 was fine with all those games which rule the market today it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless5 i cant comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i dont see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming it has a 225 watt charger in the box although it does support 33 watt charging the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my iPad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers6 the camera is okayish just like most tablet cameras the iPad has even worse cameras for document  scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in 25k range tablets7 the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers they are loud have depth are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost 4050k they will hit you as a massive surprise i did not at all expect such good speakers they seriously outmatch those cheapo 700Rs boat goat mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes separation and low end of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantitycoming to the cons1 was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldnt find a place for a 35mm jack not even a dongle in the box they should seriously stop copying apples wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates although I mitigated the issue by using portable dongle DACs like shanling ua1 ibasso dc03etc which i generally use with even my phones and my PC coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some LG phones with quad dac i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not although it works with my old MI A2 dongle just fine2 for 23000 rupees I dont expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with 23k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as Indian tablet market and its offerings but for 27k they could just offer a bundle where you pay 1k2k rupees more and get the pen as an add on3 the accessory market might not be that vibrant already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at 5000 rupees LOL the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i dont trust those type of casesone more issue that I would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by 5001000 rupees within a month or two by doing the good old GST BRO so if it ever reaches 2829k for the 128gb version just close your eyes and buy an iPad with card discountsso in a nut shell for 23K it is was no brainer but even for 27K it is a really good deal considering what its competitors arehope this was helpfulI have been using the Mi Pad 5 for over a month now and am only glad that I didnt spend more on an iPad Once the retailtherapy phase of the device wears off what remains is the user experience While it is true for both devices I find that Im more at ease with the Mi pad 5 for the sheer look and feel of the content I watch in it I also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs PDFs and I often found myself amazed almost chuffed over how good the content looked That display gets the accolades for a reasonThe Mi Pad 5 largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the iPad a gross generalisation So heres my take on Apples iPad 9th Gen vs Xiaomi Pad 5If you have an Apple device already and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet you need to stick to the iPad Not just because it is going to regulate the standard but you will definitely miss out on the features that ecosystem offersSo buy the iPad if youare not concerned about the pricetagare looking at designing with the Apple pencil and are familiar with or going to use ProCreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soonintend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the Sidecar feature  if you dont use it despite buying the iPad you are missing outengage in a lot of official videoconferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame The iPad has a feature that addresses this to an extentare not expecting substantially higher results than the Mi Pad 5 from the inbuilt camera in generalhave a proclivity towards the Apple design their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices Apple makes for youdont really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the iPad is able to do and that this list is unlikely to change in the near futurelooking for a reliable product that will receive Software support for a long period of timeare expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch IDOn the other hand buy the Mi pad 5 if youare looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the Google PlayStore and perhaps not found elsewheredont care much about the stock iOS cookiecutter experience and think customization is the only way youll truly be happy with the tablet you usewant the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet  meaning better video calls and video capture This doesnt mean the camera will replace the phone you already have but the Pad 5 is a tool that goes the extramile of taking good quality images scanning documents and allows edits on its large screenvalue videoquality from the Mi Pad camera than the AI that drives the facetracking function iPad offerswant the most of the audio experience higher audio quality clarity and richnessare expecting rich colour depth HDR quality video experience and will be spending more than 50 of your time on the tablet watching videosdont like limitations imposed on you as with the software you use sideload APKs rooting Custom Firmware overclocking etc If you do any or all of these forget about the iPadare mostly going to use it as a fun device to watch movies on or consume audiovisual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and a leg comparatively to fix a broken screen or a damaged back panelare okay without a fingerprint scanner and is okay with FaceID PIN or Pattern for securityAt the end of the day you as a user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device not the logo at the backThe tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches I have contact to Xiaomi  they will try to fix it One req dont upgraded after you buy dont have to do 1306  After the update not a single Google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many Black patches around the bar white bar sometimes nice tablet you can go with it And if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word Excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and I am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for Android l because Android 12l is good for tabletNew update is hereSo the new Android 12 update is here unfortunately is not Android 12 l but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but its totally refined from the past and system is working great 120 hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than 10 hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily 2 to 3 days because I am doing PPT Excel sheet and other documentation its work totally fine and yeah thats the new update and go for xiaomi back 5 About pencilSo I bought xiaomi pencil for 6000 and if I say latency has been improved but if if you dont have the budget of 6000 go for another shopping site which name after f cart yeah and you can buy its fsmart buy pencil for 1500 rupees it works fine too and you dont have to spend 6000 you can go with the 1500 just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note downover all i am satisfied with this

product  but hardware is not so sturdyGreat Customer SupportOverall a good Indian productReally good to help internet running during power cutsGood product and effective customer supportValue for moneyDoes Not support 4 hours as per the descriptionNo backup at all,I used this product for about 4 months and really had no issues with it until I noticed that my internet stopped working After getting it checked I found out that the issue was in the UPS maybe wiring cable which stopped transmissionI contacted the customer care and I was assisted by Mr Ankit He was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too After ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same Hoping to receive the replacement soon so that I can continue uninterrupted internet I have been using this product for the past four months during this tenure I had faced no issues initially but roughly after 3 months the power back up started shrinking extremely and the least duration was under 30 minutes thats when I contacted the customer support via whatsapp and I must say the whole experience with the customer support team was simply surprising They were very polite and helpful throughout the process It was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged a replacement for the product since it is just 34 months old They took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me a new product which I am currently using now the back up I am getting is 4 hours which is based on my usageSo finally I am not sure how often I buy a product from this brand but I will never forget the support I received from this this brand CheersI purchased the product 10 days back and initial product was not working properly But I received a replacement for that Thanks for immediate response from the support team I liked Oakter because its Indian product and NOT a Chinese As of now its working fine and no lag in WiFi connection or speed Need to test the recharge capacity when the Power goes off Will keep you updated after a month again by checking the results Giving 4 Stars as of nowThis is a really good option for those who are primarily concerned about being cut off from online meetingscalls due to frequent short term power cuts and are not willing to spend more amount buying an inverter I have been using this product since around 3 months and am pretty happy with its backupI have been using the product for more than a year Later I purchased a second product for my parents home and it was working fine for 6 months However the backup battery stopped working later and the customer support team were quick to respond and swiftly sent me the replacement productProduct was delivered very promptly and packaging was good Using this product just from couple of days and its working as expected Very easy to plug  use Reserving 1 star for longevity of this product will revise my rating after a year or so depending on my experienceThe device doesnt support for 4 hours It support only for 2 or 2 hours 30 minutes max on full rechargeProduct is affordable light and good Please dont fool on 4 hours support capacity Resonate UPS is better as compared  to thisThis product claims to give backup for upto 4hours But it wont even give backup for 30 mins I claimed warranty and got the new product as well still the same problem They reiterate and say upto 4 hours where they shud mention clearly that it will give backup upto 1 hour not more than thatOne of the worst customer support services i have seen The associates

priceVery nice mic in this price rangeIn budgetProduct Good Packaging damagedGzzzbbbbb mic ,at Rs319 its a great deal I use it for mobile vloggingNoice cancellation is not workingValue of money Good mike worth moneyVery nice mic in this price rangeAfter seeing many microphone I found thisI bought it becuase of its good ratings and reviews and in a buget price This is best for beginnersThe first time I had ordered this mic I received in a amazon plastic bag and the product box inside was completely damaged and was sealed using cello tape Also the mic seller sent me was damaged and had low quality audio It was a duplicateBut when I replaced I received the packing in a cardboard box but still the inner box had a few damagesThe mix received inside was goodHere is a detailed review of the mic1 The quality Quality overall nice The wire might seem filthy and weak but in reality when I tested it it was indeed a bit durable It can easily sustain a bit of a pull and twist Just mind the spots when the wire meets the audio jack and the mic2 Sound quality Sound quality is really nice BUT BUT BUT before you think of buying it read the paragraph below of noise cancellation The mic catches sound equally even if you are from far away or close to it3 Noise Cancellation This is a major point I used to mic a lot for testing purposes Let me share my experience I tested it in different environmentsa In a closed room with AC and total silence In such environment you will get crisp sound like a boom microphone But you will also receive a bit of white noise or background static noise which you can easily reduce using the noise reduction featureb In a room with ceiling fan on and moderate noise Still seems good but not great Your vocals would still be crispy and clear but the background noise will increase Still if you use nice noise reduction software like Audacity it will sound great Adding background music to your video would helpc In a room with standing fan on and high noise Not recommended at all Not only this mic but any mic would capture a TON of noise To express statistically there will be atleast 40 noise of wind whooshing in the backgroundd The same high noise room with windows open You will die doing noise reduction Not gonna lie the background noise increases by 60 times  DONT TRY THISThe pop filter or the sponge on the top of the mic helps a lot When you are speaking close to the mic a lot of air goes in while speaking So when the filter is attached the output sound does not have air whooshing but with the filter removed the output sound is only airNow to sum upMic is overall good Noise cancellation is not great but yeah for the price range it is the bestRecording tips1 Record in a silent room with AC or else turn on the fan at the least speed so it doesnt make much noise2 Use the collar clip to place the mic dont hold it in hand  I mean this is common sense P 3 If transmission lines electricity wires which are above the head go from close to your room I would recommend changing roomsNow the reason for this is that sometimes the mic can catch electromagnetic intefrerence  This maono mic wont catch it but I recommend this for generic mics4 Do noise reduction in Audacity It is very effective than the inbuilt noise reduction tools in video editors Also it is very easyAlso BOYA BYM1 MIC SOUNDS ALMOST THE SAME AS THIS MIC There is only like 2 difference in noise cancellation But I would still give both of them 3 stars for noise cancellationTHATS ITHope you understand what I mean to sayPeace outNice

know how to use and what to use it forGood for nonprofessional recordingsBuy this and start creating content for your youtubeLong cable should be optional its too long else good mic for beginners on YTWorking as expectedNice productGood ,NOTE  Its ready to go Mic which doesnt need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones Has 35mm jack connector built in you can use 14 connector if needed It has very Long cable which measures upto 20 feet so note that It has absolutely NO noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in STOCK condition but with SIMPLE EDITING this mic works just fine  Check the review below for detailed settings There are literally thousands of review on this product but NONE explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with Audacity software or even in general So I took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones So I went to search for best settings on amazon  other sources but in vain Fortunately I myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fineFirst I am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that I found and then listing those settingsPROS 1 Built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given2 Length of cable is insane 20 feet I personally didnt find it useful as I use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with Camera3 Has universal 35mm jack which is handy4 Its easy to use just plug and play device which doesnt need any sound card or external device to work5 Has support for multiple device right from smartphones to DSLRs and computers6 It comes with carry pouch which is very handy since its a mess with such long cablesCONS 1 Biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box Its just garbage quality and even normal ears cant bear the background noise collection so forget about audiophiles My normal smartphones earphones record much better sound quality compared to this2 Length of cable is way too much for me and I guess for many users I think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable3 It comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and theres NO way to know whether the battery is dead or whats its charging level Only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test So if you are carrying it with recorder which doesnt has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me its very frustrating  I am mentioning it as this scenario have happened with me once hence I am very cautious about batteries now  use it with smartphones or digital recorders4 I think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less considering the sound qualityBEST SETTING USING AUDACITY SOFTWARE These are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use Audacity software which is Free 1 Open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic2 Select entire audio clip and open Effects and then  DISTORTION 3 Start the playback of audio clip in the software so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make4Now select  Distortion Type  option on the top of box and select  Soft Clipping  or select  Hard Limiter  and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you5 Take the Clipping Level cursor to extreme Right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output6 Adjust the Makeup Gain cursor little bit if needed I keep it on 49 Here you can select which ever type which you feel is suitable for you7 Now just click  APPLY 8 Now is Noise reduction For that Select short section of audio which DOES NOT have your voice but ONLY has background noises that you dont want9 Open Effects and then  Noise Reduction 10 Click on  Get Noise Profile11 Now select entire audio clip and again Open Effects and then  Noise Reduction 12 Finally click on  OK  and thats it Now you are good to go with soft slightly lesser Noises and more pleasant sound output After these steps you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user softwareVERDICT I personally am very disappointed with the sound quality though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level but its satisfactory enough Plus price seems slightly more on this I wouldnt recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment Buy this only if you live in very silent conditionsIts not great or best out there for beginners but goodI use a budget midrange phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone record it in WAV format its goodYou gotta use softwareapps to pull the best of this like audacity or some other editing appIts pretty long and thats good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripodOverall its decent for beginners I see highend phones have good recording capabilities but if you have a budget phone then this one is dealMicrophone looks very well built it supports both phones and cameras There are some phones that does not support external mic please check before buying as one of my phone did not support itThey claim noise cancellation however I did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone I could not observe noise cancellation at least while recording on phoneOverall package is well bundled wire quality is decent however the dongle quality is excellent even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solidWire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then 5 stars from me but now 4 star good sound low price 1 star  for wire quality but over all a nice productI think Its good for online teaching like I doBut yeah some problems like very long cable length I mean someone might need but it should be optional or detachable price of the Mic itself is not much anywaysI am okay with this mic for sometime until I am sure I need quality Rode mic to upgradeDont expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very goodNice

at the lowest price and it is not bad at allGood Bluetooth ProjectorWhat more can you ask for at this priceGood for winter nightsNice purchaseValue for moneyWORTH EVERY PENNY SPENTValue for money,This review is for the native FHD projectorYes it is a native 1080p led projector connected this to my desktop computer and tested also Dont bother trying to play videos from USB Quality is badBut when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi it is actually quite good I mean picture quality colours brightness etc for a sub 10k projector In this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub 15k rangesSound is also pretty much okay loud enough more like boat 5w speakers may be a bit more louder not good quality wise Quitr workable as portable solution but not for a permanent setupAudio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also Meaning 21 speakers can be connected to it for a higher setup person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itselfFrom 9ft and 34 inches distance of lens to wall we can get exactly 100 inch87 inch x 49 inch projection So it can be called as short throw projector albiet may be border level There is an option to reduce the screen size upto 75 of original size electronically once connected to HDMIKeystone correction is not usuable at all That wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screenThat means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location Can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction I e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels projector also has to fixed at lower levels only Best focus can be get when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably 5 to 6 inch above so if we flip the projector upside down we get best focus opposite to center a few inches downFor mysetup where projecting only 15 feet above from the floor going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down this way i can fix the projector a bit more abovebehind the sofa I will post the pics later once it is setup properlyNow the verdict  this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand is one of most vfm combo for approx 11k for experiencing a very bright 100 inch screen experience of good quality for 1 or 2 person  But now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of 15k to 30k im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projectorlook only ANSI value This buy was more of an impulse purchase but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projectorEdit the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel which impacts the clarity also after a few days I had to clean the panel myselg just after 15 month  New lesson learnt apart from high ansi lumen projector this is also an important factor for future purchase Planning to get a custom cloth cover made so that i dont have to clean it often Though Lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model Somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet Only the lcd has very very fine dust particles insideQuality is good value for Money Bluetooth Connectivity is smooth and fast The sound quality of the Projector is not so great but that we had already considered before Hotstar App really works nicely with great quality and so does Youtube Netflix  Prime video doesnt give the same quality initially but that must be wifi connection Some apps however dont get installed or just close on their ownThe good point is the Bluetooth connection and even we have added a Bluetooth soundbar so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good optionThis is indeed a fantastic product in this price rangeit is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through HDMIneedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day ie if you can cover up your windows and other light sourcesScreen spread is Almost up to 120 inch at a throw distance of 13 to 1 feet with the sharpness more or less intactconverts 4K to 1080PWill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mineensure that the walls are white for best image  video reproductionDefinitely recommended at this price pointConsOnly vertical Keystone correction availableProjector is good so far as it used for last 3 days May revisit the feedback after a couple of monthsI bought this projector for my classroom and its very helpful for their studies Now students connect themselves more to the worldI feel Its a value for money product as I have already used it for last two monthsIf u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further THIS IS IT BEST IN PRICE GOOD PICTURE QUALITY BRIGHTNESS AND A DECENT REMOTE WITH GOOD FUNCTIONALITY As always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs Very good for family get together movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity Ive canceled my dth connection Coz AMAZON PRIME TV STICK WITH THIS PROJECTOR IS ALL I NEED THATS ALL THE TIME I HAVE FOR WATCHING TV AMIDST MY WORK AND THEY DO THE JOB WELL An entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied Any queries ping me Ill help u as much as i can Dont worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family manit will satisfy all ur needsbe it surfing movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too Hope it helpsUPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS  4HRSDAY USAGE The pic uploaded was by noon 1pm with dark screensHI THIS WAS A REPLY TO A CUSTOMER TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN EGATE I9 N UC 68  46  BUT I THOUGHT IF THIS WAS PUT UP IN UPDATE SECTION A LOT WOULD BENEFIT SO HERE IT GOESFirst u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if its for offic use or home entertainment also u didnt mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc since u have not ill go with a general review for purposes ITS GOING TO BE A VERY DETAILED REVIEW SO GUYS WITH OUT PATIENCE CAN RUN TO THE END AT ONCEI too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i9 from uc 68  46 Let me tell u what helped me decideFirst n foremost egate is an Indian company unlike uc which is a common Chinese product with a namesake brand UC confirmed it with my friend in China Hence service n general trust is more on egate than competitionSecondly from fellow customers Ive learnt that egate is brighter than the rest twoThirdly the images are sharp and theres no blur on text on egate compared to the other two Just learn to adjust the keystone properlyFourth the length of the power cord is longer in egateFifth its got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use The others dont have itNow in general Ive not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users so Im gonna tell u wat Ive done n wat else u can do with egateIve placed it at a length of 15 feet from the screen n it gives awesome display Connect a 21 51 home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at 23 feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping aroundIve connected my SECOND FIRE TV Stick with it so it connects to WiFi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n FF Also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etcU get a remote which functions well along with itMOST IMPORTANTLY U CAN CEILING MOUNT IT OR TRIPOD IT TOO WHICH THE OTHER TWO CANT BUT remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by 180 in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod its not necessaryAlso u can place the projector behind the screen LIKE AN ACTUAL THEATRE IF U R USING A CLOTH SCREEN LIKE ME N CONSTRAINT OF SPACE BUT REMEMBER TO FLIP THE IMAGE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IN SETTINGS AS THE PROJECTOR IS BEHIND THE SCREEN N U NEED TO GET A 90 FLIPPED IMAGE FROM BEHINDso I guess its the 3d part that made ur decision murky wat I would love to say for that is Ive a Samsung 3d enabled smart tv n Ive seen the output of these kind of cheap 3d devices too since its a low cost projector 3d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a TV if 3d is a priority as in TV the 3d effects r awesome But nowadays u can install an APP IN ANY DEVICE to watch 3d movies or better download a 3d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur 3d glasses My friends do it but I DONTVERDICT  BEST PROJECTOR IN MARKET IN MY OPINION FOR THE PRICE AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSENOTE  FOR AMAZON PRIME N NETFLIX USERS IF U R USING A 21 AUDIO OUTPUT SOMETIMES U MIGHT NOT GET AUDIO SO DONT GET WORRIED N ITS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROJECTOR ITS JUST THAT THE LATEST MOVIES ARE MADE WITH DOLBY 51 SOUND SO JUST USE THE ON SCREEN SETTING IN THE VIDEO TO NAVIGATE TO SOUND N CHOOSE STEREO FROM THE DEFAULT DOLBY OPTION  VOILA U R DONEHOPE IT HELPS PING ME FOR ANY DOUBTSHIT LIKE IF MY REVIEW WAS USEFULAs per money its bestBut if you are fan of pictures qualityThink about budget,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51DhRNtyo0L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Support-Display-Projector-Connectivity-E03i31/dp/B088Z1YWBC/ref=sr_1_176?qid=1672909133&s=electronics&sr=1-176

review its been working fine theres been no problem as of now some thingsthe whole step tracking thing i bought it due to that reason it didnt basically satisfy me to that level with that but it does count steps accurately in the walking modeactivityIts got some scratches in it but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds I believe it couldve been wayyyy better if we could change 45

differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accuratei still havent understood it that well lolbattery life is muah I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 67 daysspo2 and heart rate I just believe what it says as i cant check prove if thats correctthe water resistance I havent used it in water ofc am scared the calling feature works fine its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch Ive used this product for 4 days and im going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here So Bluetooth calling 45  the inbuilt mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance watch connects smoothly with the mobile and dont get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone Only con is you cant silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime hope they fix it with an updateBuilt quality and looks 455  metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting Best thing is it also looks good over skinny wristspoor me with 56 inch wrist Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guardTouch screen 55  its almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k I bet you will not get any laggy experience everAccuracy 355  SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies it gives you a rough idea of your being so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k Count steps with decent accuracy as well Sleep accuracy is also just acceptableTo sum up you should definitely go for this watch if youve a budget constrained under 2000 rsI recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch which is quite stylish and the Bluetooth calling is excellent The voice gets to the other side without any disturbanceThe build quality is good over the wrists but you can get scratches on the display so protect it with some screen guard You should go for this watch if you want a budgetfriendly smartwatch under 2000Its a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls youi think you should purchase it if in future company add these two featuresI recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch and I am very happy with my purchase The watch is quite stylish and I get compliments every time I wear it The watch is also quite comfortable to wear and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size The watch also has a great battery life and I can go for days without having to charge it The watch also has a number of features including a step counter heart rate monitor and sleep tracker All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watchThis watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money Really pleased with the design and shape of watch definitely a must buy for every person loved the colour durability and accuracy is super  just go for itI liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking sp02 Heart rate measuring music player temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome

SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS SMART WATCHNice qualityDisplay is awsomeSleep tracking,Original 3rd Jan 2021 This is my first smartwatch I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family but this is my personal first I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and Im aware of most of the products in the budget range While I can afford a slightly more expensive one GTS2GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro Oppo Watch Fitbit etc with calling feature I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa yet to be included but must be available through an OTA update Id have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro It still isnt released in IndiaComing to the watchs performance the typical features I tried today first day are Heart RATE HR SPO2 Stress monitoring and GPS I have a pulse oximeter from Dr Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2 The numbers on the watch arent very accurate to my surprise heart rate variation by 510 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10 points at times  But I still feel its more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house It wont surprise me if I dont get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone Music controls worked fine bluetooth data transfer or sync was good I couldnt control the phone camera as I couldnt get that feature to work refer to image and help me if you can I didnt face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications The readability on the watch screen has been really good Tried a couple of workouts While the step count seems to be fine not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modesTo conclude I wouldnt say that this watch is a disappointment but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats Probably I should give it more time but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy at least the Honor bands Ive seen Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as Im curious what all it can doI would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days Lets seeUpdate 8th Jan 2021 The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out Im hardly getting it for 35 days with always on display and an occasional workout Limited watch faces both on device 4 and the app 57 Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display Waterproof nature of the device is good I didnt dip it in water but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action I got the camera shutter to work I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa Notifications didnt have an issue but could not clear individual items clear all workedREVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS 2 Mini Smart watch 2021 modelHello everyone  Since the new model of amazfit GTS2 mini arrived  i am going to review the old model of itProsDisplay  155 inch amoled display  really good look   prosBattery  coming with 220 maH  from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer  normal use   But If you are a light user it can last it for 14 days  ProIP rating IP 68 water resistant which is cool ProHeartbeat sensor  It has heartbeat sensor and it is real  but it may not show real accuracy at all the time  But it performs good proComfortness  It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material proWork out modes  There are nearly 70 workout modes and i tested out some  since it is built in GPS  it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well procan track stressHas PAI feature to progress your workout with better experienceAlexa assistant  but need phone connection to activate this Has other modes like breathing menstrual cycle trackingtodolist  inbuilt alarm pomodoro timer sleep tracker Timer  In built compass  camera remote find the phone  controlling music etcNotification system  you can get notifications Call control system  You can accept or reject calls  but you cannot able to talk through watchConsBuild quality it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium  and half is poly carbonate con Watch faces  the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good  conSPO2  I dont know how much accurate it is  but coming to technical part  the sensors are failing most of the times  Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history conVerdict It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality The incoming call notification disconnects if youre away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch I have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors even though its not Damaged Water resistance is good I used to wash dishes wearing it No use of Alexai think its a good buy after 2 months of usageall over Amazfit GTS2 Mini New Version is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback apart for this other things are really niceSleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watchRather all thing are fantastic and battery life is 7 day in normal

priceWatch faces could have been betterAmoled Screen  Touch Average Wrist Band,Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros Amoled Display is very bright and nice Look and design is premium Bluetooth calling is awesome speaker is loud and clear  Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch calculator features is useful Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful  Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx song sound quality is also fine strap quality is good and soft TWS connecting features is also niceCons sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass  i have attached the pic for itHealth Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price rangei have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different 7080 accurate only AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch  like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phoneSometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker which is quite irritatingthis must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs3420 including bank offer  For this price range overall its a good  premium watch Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that dependsRecieved a damaged device at first Slight gap between display and body from the left side but quickly recieved the replacement next dayThe replacement was goodAmazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours so great job amazonalso i live in bangalore so the experience might vary from place to placeProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price good speakers and good micYou can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch And it is seamlessDisplay is great colors are punchy and bezels are good enough Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enoughBuild quality is good but does not feel very premium it does feel like a below 5k watchSo you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch Strap is not too long as every review mentions strap is good enough Not too comfyI ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazingUi looks much better in person than reviews UI is smooth and looks good Not as good as realme watch 3 proBut still good for the priceOverall its a good watch for the price of around 35k 39kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 proOr else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reasonwhich is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walkingso dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 daysBlutooth range is not too good and varies from watch to watch and also phone to phone i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft  but this is more of a fact than a conI write this review after 1 week of using this watch BP BPM SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it overall its a good watchEverything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatchBut these things could have been better Watch faces you should have the option to add upto 34 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 preinstalled ones App ui could have been better DND mode absent No option to toggle Bluetooth always onBefore review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucherI loved the Touch Screen experience  Amoled screen of the watch it gives a feel of premium watch The band of the watch is average  doesnt look premium  i separately ordered a metal band I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I dont find it good enough if I compare it with Boats App for its watches As I own a Boat smartwatch Rest Visionary is a good buy  worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41dtbrNRHdL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Fire-Boltt-Smartwatch-Resolution-Connection-Assistance/dp/B0B3NDPCS9/ref=sr_1_459?qid=1672895886&s=electronics&sr=1-459

worth the moneyGood budget smart watch with AlexaGood productI dont have flashlight function and speaker is not workingNiceIts little costWach not working,Review OverviewAverage27The Boat today launched the  Boat Xtend  the companys latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs 2999 The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch Moreover it has builtin Amazon Alexa support SpO2 tracking stress tracking and much more Coming in a budget segment is it worth it Should you buy this smartwatch If you too have such queries then there is nothing to worry about It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about itContentsBox ContentDesign Build  ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy NowBox ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in blackgold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign Build  ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch one always thinks about its design and look Apart from features design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3 but it cannot be compared to that Obviously in every aspect Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design but the build quality is much premium on this oneBoat Xtend design and buildI personally dont like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame I believe the gold color would fade away after some time There are three other color variants which also dont look stylish as this one However that is my personal opinion on the color scheme so maybe you might find the color scheme to be goodBoat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance It has silicon straps which are quite comfortable The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usageDisplayComing to the display the watch has a 42mm square shape display What you see on this one is a TFT panel The screen has big bezels however the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off so you wont notice the bezels and the screen quality wont feel cheap at all It doesnt have an alwayson display but we cannot complain about that The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness controlBoat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat View angle is good on this one and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight The color on this one is not very saturated but this isnt something that we can complain about in this price rangeWatch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use There is a single button on the watch which works as the poweroff button as well as the back button Moreover the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem There isnt much animation on the bar menu and the navigation is simple so you wont find it difficult to use However the watch may lag a bit The company has done costcutting in terms of the processor thats why you may find it to lag a bit but it is OK and not a big deal at the price point you get itBoat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity which includes total steps walked calories burnt and time heart rate sleep tracking stress tracking breath training SpO2 training meditation find my phone and music control Apart from that there are 14 different support modes on this watch I tried a few of them and they worked fine The watch notifies you of the incoming calls messages received and various other notifications in detailBoat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support The watch has an inbuilt microphone and you can access it by longpressing the back button Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm setting a timer and such Well it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch but you wont find it very useful Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement and then you wont prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks So even if Boat missed this feature it wont be a problemBoat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch and probably more watch faces will be added to it Moreover you can also set a custom watch face as wellBoat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices You wont be seeing bugs on the app and it works perfectly I havent noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple You will get all the fitnessrelated options and all the watch settings on the app itselfBoat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch So talking about the accuracy I tested everything on this watch from normal walking to running sleeping and much more and I find the results to be accurateBoat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch the result was the same on all of them So there is no problem with the accuracy I dont find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers but yes this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking sleep tracking and everything it doesBoat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate

launched the  Boat Xtend  the companys latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs 2999 The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch Moreover it has builtin Amazon Alexa support SpO2 tracking stress tracking and much more Coming in a budget segment is it worth it Should you buy this smartwatch If you too have such queries then there is nothing to worry about It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about itContentsBox ContentDesign Build  ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy NowBox ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in blackgold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign Build  ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch one always thinks about its design and look Apart from features design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3 but it cannot be compared to that Obviously in every aspect Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design but the build quality is much premium on this oneBoat Xtend design and buildI personally dont like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame I believe the gold color would fade away after some time There are three other color variants which also dont look stylish as this one However that is my personal opinion on the color scheme so maybe you might find the color scheme to be goodBoat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance It has silicon straps which are quite comfortable The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usageDisplayComing to the display the watch has a 42mm square shape display What you see on this one is a TFT panel The screen has big bezels however the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off so you wont notice the bezels and the screen quality wont feel cheap at all It doesnt have an alwayson display but we cannot complain about that The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness controlBoat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat View angle is good on this one and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight The color on this one is not very saturated but this isnt something that we can complain about in this price rangeWatch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use There is a single button on the watch which works as the poweroff button as well as the back button Moreover the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem There isnt much animation on the bar menu and the navigation is simple so you wont find it difficult to use However the watch may lag a bit The company has done costcutting in terms of the processor thats why you may find it to lag a bit but it is OK and not a big deal at the price point you get itBoat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity which includes total steps walked calories burnt and time heart rate sleep tracking stress tracking breath training SpO2 training meditation find my phone and music control Apart from that there are 14 different support modes on this watch I tried a few of them and they worked fine The watch notifies you of the incoming calls messages received and various other notifications in detailBoat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support The watch has an inbuilt microphone and you can access it by longpressing the back button Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm setting a timer and such Well it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch but you wont find it very useful Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement and then you wont prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks So even if Boat missed this feature it wont be a problemBoat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch and probably more watch faces will be added to it Moreover you can also set a custom watch face as wellBoat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices You wont be seeing bugs on the app and it works perfectly I havent noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple You will get all the fitnessrelated options and all the watch settings on the app itselfBoat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch So talking about the accuracy I tested everything on this watch from normal walking to running sleeping and much more and I find the results to be accurateBoat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch the result was the same on all of them So there is no problem with the accuracy I dont find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers but yes this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking sleep tracking and everything it doesBoat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in womenBoat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one which the company claims to last 7 days However if you use

product for short power cutoffsGood productsReviewGreat choice if you want a wifi UPS with good battery backup,It is giving good backupI am using it for wifi router backup but sometime on powercut it quickly dont gives power to the wifirouter so wifi gets turned off for some timeTalking abt this product I was confused to go with a well known brand or this brand as it was almost half rate I quite impressed with packaging n box content they are USPNext comes plastic quality that is also good installation was also easy by following manual link for video would be more helpfulIt do have sometime connecting issue thats randomWhich could be the reason this is reasonably pricedNext version should improve that rest happy with purchaseIt provides excellent backup for above 4 hrs but during power cut the router restarts once again which created interruption in the internet connections for few minutes Overall an Awesome ProductI have tested and its working for power backup up to 2 hrsPerfect for wifi usage upto 3 hrs of power backup provided Easy to install and useGood productsUpdate 21 Item runs 1hr 14m 1A giving 15465Wh runs 48m 15A giving 1482Wh whereas its rated at 222Wh  since its april21 made id say battery is defective  wont last me long ordered replacement2 Replacement runs 1h 32m 1A giving 1939Wh 1h 1m 15A giving 18452Wh  being made in nov20 i think this batt is alright Im keeping the replacement  ending my review unless item fails catastrophicallyUpdate1 This is what make in India has become a plethora of Indian registered companies slapping their logo  selling chinese items in India to cash in Indian sentiments This is a generic item sold by slapping diff brand names like zinq quantum available right here on amazon  prolly more Even the boxes r exactly same lol2 Recharge rate is horribly slow 05A so 22Ah will take 44hrs considering losses 45hrs Thats why frequent power cut ppl r complaining about 1hr standby So its basically for ppl with occasional power cuts like me with community generator3 Ups has to be turned ON to recharge what why lame This is another reason ppl r complaining about charging issue  since item is generic ZINQ prolly doesnt even know lol such a dumb thing must be printed on the center of the box itself I myself was fooled for 6hrs thinking that its charging but it went cold so checked with power meter  wow It didnt charge a bit4 Had i been younger with lotza free time i couldve made one myself for 80808015050 for 18Ah one Gone r those fun days So Im keeping it for 1001 if any1 is reading my review youtube search for router ups  lotza young ppl with free time have made such DIYDamn this thing can output over 35watts of power 12v For the 1st time something has outspecked my 35w load testerPros1 Can output 3A or even more that i could test Great for sudden load surge2 Very stable output 12121v throughout 035w3 Solid built almost all possible connectors provided seamless switching from AC to battery obviously easy to useCons1 No polarity changing option for inout Some itemschargers do have center negative for that i have to make my own cable2 Since it went 3A or above i dont think theres any overloadshort circuit protection3 Item got quite hot when run at 12v 2A for 15mins I hope theres thermal protection4 Item is sealed shut Any repair or future battery change will be destructiveIt works as intended and gives

or downstairs Overall great purchase Must buyNeed little better customer supportgoodI expected much stronger signal 10 meter away Its okay working but not as expectedtp link is good productGood productDecided on buying this Router from TPLink after days of research reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different modelsWas on a 20 Mbps connection with a Netgear N300 router since 2016 which used to suffice for moderate usage till now However with increase in the number of devices like Smart TV 2 iPads and a laptop etc it necessitated an upgrade Also considering the current workfromhome scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well the internet usage was being stretched to its limit and the trusted Netgear router simply couldnt match up to the increased bandwidth demandTo capitalise on the current situation our current ISP came out with interesting Fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection That in turn needed a new router to utilize its optimum potential Finally zeroed in on the TPLink Archer C80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers Was also tempted to buy the AX1500 considering theres barely any price difference but then came across a few reviews which stated that Wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devicesOrder delivered by Amazon within a day Full marks for the seamless delivery as always Prime has truly been a boonInstalled the Router today Installation via Tether App was seamless ISP guy helped with the PPPOE signin process and released the MAC ID which was bound to our old Router The whole process was done in 10 mins and we were onlineThe dual bands are truly a boon Have divided the devices at home equally between 24G and 5G as per usage As the router is close to the TV unit have connected it to 5G and also alternatively connected via the Ethernet cable just in caseSpeed testsStarted off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5G Played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connectedHave attached a few pictures for reference Sitting near the Router 5G Download speed is 77 mbps and Upload is 754 mbps 5G speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between Download 724 mbps and Upload 749 mbps 24G speed in the same room as the Router is Download 683 mbps and Upload 792 mbps This is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 5055 mbps will be the threshold for 24G Used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old N300 Speed Test via the Ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the TV Download 78 mbps and Upload 75 mbpsCouldnt have asked for more really This seems to be totally idealBuild quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job however would have preferred that they were placed like other TPLink models like the Archer A6 so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directionsThe LED lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough Maybe Im used to the prominent lights on my old Router These are a blinkandmiss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case theres an issue One big element missing in this device is a USB port which is absolutely essential in todays age and expected to be included for this price range Wonder whats the reason behind giving it a missI have sealed the extra LAN ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture Its a good practice The outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish however Im a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portionFunctionally though this seems to be a real good offering from TPLink Hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days Allinall seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years considering an internet plan upgrade if anyHope I touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice This product is RECOMMENDED

usageGood product and received latest V4Good Budget Gigabit Router with Beamforming and multiple options in firmwareRange is issue for 5g every whereValue For MoneyGo for itSuper Signal support install,I really liked this router for a smallish space The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistentHowever it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is Its the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a years usage And to make it worse theres dismal after sales serviceI tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasnt stable I think Ill finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers Hopefully Ill find a good maker Good RouterAfter researching lot I settled on TP link A6I was looking for better range router this Router really worth the price Dual band guest wifi I upgraded from tenda n301 and performance is really goodRange for 5Gz is not that good as 25Gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than thisI was using Tenda AC 10 router since 2019 for 100Mbps connection from Local ISP Mach1 Broadband Mumbai Most of devices 5 Mobiles 4 Laptops 1 Firestick at my home work on 5Ghz except 1 CCTV camera Range of Tenda AC 10 was good and used Digisol AC750 repeater for farthest room of my 2 BHK homeIn recent lightning strike in Mumbai power adapter of Tenda AC10 got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter I was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget I tried 2 routers Mercusys AC1900 MR50G  TP Archer C80 AC1900 before this Both Routers didnt meet my expectation Range and speed of these 2 routers were poor than my earlier Tenda AC10 Amazon accepted returns without a single question Thumbs up to AmazonAfter some more research I zeroed on TP link Archer A6  C6 As per comparison on TP link website both are identical routers After doing some more research on blogs and reviews I found that Archer A6 is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from Qualcomm Hence purchased Archer A6 Feature of Onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future Separate Wifi SSID with same strength on both 24  5 Ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser as per TP link support page this is dedicated wifi link for Onemesh repeatersNow for router Router is same as Tenda AC10 for coverage it can not cover farthest room in 2BHK on 5Ghz 24 Ghz band can cover 2BHK house but speed is around 30 Mbps on 100 Mbps plan However speed on Archer A6 is better that Tenda AC10 Im getting 90 Mbps upload and download consistently on devices 515 feet apart in 5Ghz TP Link Archer A6 is better than costlier AC1900 routers Just for info I received US version v2 of router instead of EU version mentioned on TP Link India website Hence firmware on TP Link India website will not match with device firmware However this device has auto update option directly from Internet Also router can be managed by TPLink Tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using TP link account on both router and Tether appBy trying so many routers i understood that 5Ghz range will be week even with costliest router Instead of using Digisol AC750 repeater i installed my old Tenda AC10 in repeater mode for 5Ghz 24 Ghz disabled Now my complete home is covered by 5Ghz signal In the farthest room i receive download  upload speed of around 75 MbpsI also tried old TP link Archer C50 which i had purchased when abroad performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks Gigabit ports Beamforming  MUMIMOMy ISP has connected my link on Gigabit port of their switch in my society However cabling is only 2 pair CAT 5e which supports max 100 Mbps full duplex I will try to get cabling changed to either 4 Pair CAT 5E or CAT6 from ISP and check the performance I will update review after cabling changeSo in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with Gigabit ports Beamforming  MUMIMO even if your internet speed is less than 100Mbps as it is future proof TP Lnk Archer A6 is good router meeting all requirement within the budgetHope this review is useful in search of good futureproof routerEdit 1My ISP tried to replace my connection to FTTH and this router was connected to Fiber ONU using Gigabit Port It worked only for 15 mins Max speed was 230 Mbps ISP was not able to resolve the FTTH issue and changed cable to 4 Pair CAT5e which supports Gigabit transmission Now net speed is around 160 Mbps My internet plan is 100 Mbps Im happy with the speed I have asked ISP to change my connection to FTTH at last Tenda AC10 is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of Archer A6 using CAT5e cable Now complete home received stable wifi of 160 Mbps on 5Ghz bandI will update once again when FTTH connection is successfulGood product till now 1 monthI am very SatisfiedI am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and I used to reconnect it and the same way VPN  is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting Now I am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well Finally i am not seeing any issue with this router It is helping me during work from home Please go aheadIts easy to use easy to install  more function to control the router,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41VDUqScJFL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Archer-A6-Wireless-Internet/dp/B07W9KYT62/ref=sr_1_415?qid=1672903016&s=computers&sr=1-415

which serves the purpose of low volume on a phone or laptopbestIts OK to use in small room But for Outdoor activities it will not meet our expectationsAwesome product,Bahut hi achha product hai badhiya saund and bluetooth connectivityBuild material is plastic body However sound was goodNiceSound quality is goodBattery performance goodIt is a satisfactory Bluetooth speaker and is perfect choice for those who are looking for a budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money It serves these purpose very well and is not pricey Why I am saying all thisFirst things first I got this at 549 the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case 2 My laptop and phone volume  is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience So here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent size of speaker is conveniently small lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome After a complete charge I used this speaker for continuously for about 6 hours at about 80 volume and still the speaker is left with 60 charge I cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than 70 charge and I just topped it to full Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto 10 mtrs FM reception is average without connecting the datacharging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected It has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only First button M is mode which when pressed switches from Bluetooth to FM to Aux to Usbmemory card Transition of switching is flawless Volume updown keys are used to change volume and switch the channels Long press changes the volume and short pressclick changes the channels in FM or changes the track via Aux Most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic Yes you can actually use this speaker when connected to phone to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues Voice clarity is very good for the calls made MUSIC CLARITY IS NOT VERY GOOD READ CONS FOR THIS Quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durableCONS Sound quality is just average  Voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant But when it comes to music this speaker struggles to deliver quality People are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality This is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality But this is manageable and you can ADJUST THE MUSIC EQUALIZERS in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality This is the reason I dont consider its music quality a con for the product Theres one limitation about charging connector to It comes with a charging port compatible to AB type connector so if you have a charger with data cable supporting C type connectors you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only So you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker Instead you will have to carry two different cables This speaker does not come with a charger so you will have to use your mobiles charger 5v 1A  for the purpose But for the price rage this seems reasonableUseful tip for buyers Most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker But you can install any of these two apps Bluebatt or Bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level from the playstore if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speakerWhat you get in complete package 1 unit of Bluetooth speaker 1 cable which has Aux connector USB connector and AB type micro Usb connector 1 tiny  user manualQuality of packaging Excellent

200Its just a speaker with less soundOkay to buySound is not much loud in maximum volumeBoat rocks alwaysExcellent VFM PRODUCT BUT THERES MORE TO IT READ ONExcellent sound quality i like this speaker sooooooo much ,This is review is primarily focused on sound qualityThe term Bass is used losely One doesnt expect true Bass from such small driversSHORTER VERSIONBoat Stone 650 Very loud Loud and somewhat uneven bass Mids are a bit supressed Somewhat muffled midrange Decent treble A loud bassy speakerNakamichi Speck Barely louder than the 3W Stone 200 Mids clearer than 650 Bass much much lower than 650 If looking for VFM rule this one out unless this is on a big discount and others arent Overall fairly even sound at a questionable price and volumeBoat 200 More bass than expected of a tiny 3W speaker but lesser than Speck and way lesser than 650 Excellent midrange and terble Much lounder than what you may expect of a 3W speaker Amazing speaker in a tiny package with insufficent bassLONGER VERSIONI have had the 200 for years and many have asked me to order it for them It is an excellent tiny satisfying package The midrange vocals and treble is excellent and matches speakers several times it price If bass is not what you are after you are unlikely to find a better package even at a much higher price point especially if you care for even soundBy Even Sound I mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well  no major suppression or enhancementI checked the others as I usually hear music on a semipro system and the insufficent bass lowermids bothered meNakamichi USED to be a Japanese company making very high end tape decks in the 90s so the benchmarks were high now it is a China based company The 25W raised expectations further As said it is barely louder than the 3W Stone 200 It is fairly even sound but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the 200 If you dont care about the money and want something better than the 200 with even sound this could be it The mids and terble are a tiny bit better in the 200 Speck also has a larger battery giving substantially longer backup and better water protection useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house  The Stone 650 is miles ahead in bass and loudness if that is what you care for amongst the 3  your choice is simple The bass is uneven however All three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators One should not expect much nuance in bass from those If a thump is what you care for  yes it is certainly there for the size With somewhat uncontrolled bass the midrange is compromised  somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled No it is not major and many mgiht not even really notice it much The transiton between mid and lowermidsbass isnt great One usually doesnt expect as much from such speakers but the Boat Stone 200 set the bar high  very highKeep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers speaker are in the direction of your ears It makes the midrange a bit better Reduces the bass a bit but makes the sound more even Tough it is impractical to keep it so it makes the sound a lot closer to what I desireSOME EXTRASPlacement of these speakers makes a big difference Keep them about 6 away from a wall ideally a corner for enhanced bass and fuller soundIf you look at teardown videos youll notice that the 650 has much bigger magnets than the others It is a heavy speaker I like that since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further It is well designed except the  and  volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive useThe 650 can also be placed vertically That too changes the sound Lesser bass and possibly a bit clearer on the whole reduced bass  less intrusion into the mids in such speakersSpeaker characterics change subtly over 100 odd hours of use Often quite prominent in the first hour so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hourConclusionNakamichi Speck More even sound than the other two not at all as loud as expected better waterprof rating bigger battery high priced despite Chinese  Buy if you dont care for the money volume and are okay wihtout much bassBoat Stone 200 it is a star Excellent even sound however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back If you are on a budget or if you dont care much for bass especially for lecturesdocumentaries or vocal music this is brilliant I have used it for longBoat 650 Heavy Loud Lots of bass If you can deal with the somewhat and it is not big unevenness and slightly muffled sound  it is a good packageFor my needs I added the 650 to my equipment list while keeping the 200PS This was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews I have gained fromSoundIts okay to buySound is not much loud its below my expectations1 Low price2 Awesome sound3 Battery life should be more so cutting down 1 star but overall good4 Gives feeling of home theatre5 Multiple connectivity is also goodLoved

for more than a month Works HDMI USB well so far Not tested the MicroSD slotsBuild quality is great Im using this with my MacBook it works fine  While using this adapter Amazon prime videos cant play in 1080p resolution on monitor it says the devices not support hd  Other ports are working fine not a problemI took this for my macbook m2 pro 2022 edition and it is working perfectlyall the ports are working fine till now its been 2 month i am using it  length of the wire is little small it could be little big and the price is also little high it could be under 900rs then it will justifyIf you bought a MacBook Air or Pro recently and wondering what to do about all the missing ports  USB HDMI etc this is your one stop solutionI tried on my MacBook Air M2 and it works like a charm I connected various pen drives disk drives and a 128 go flash drive  all worked fineVery reasonably priced compared to other options yet has a fairly good look and feelEverything working fine but it doesnt works with Macbooks HDMI when try to connect one plus TV as an extended screen different displays on both but works fine if used as second screen with common displaySolved my problemI got the product on 11th August 2022 This is the initial impression1 Packaging  The package I received was in good condition it had a pre wrapped plastic on the box No complaint about packaging but one thing to note is that No Brand name on the packaging Although when you open the product  the brand name is there on the product2 Build  Wire length is small to my opinion It has a metal build finish and looks premium and sturdy Wire quality is also good but at this price should have provided braided cable3 I have tested this product with 3 usb ports connected  a Mouse b Keyboard cExternal 2TB SSD SSD does not get disconnected when all 3 usb are connected For confirmation i did a 2 gb file transfer and No disconnections were noticedNote  The Speed of the data transfer is low I did 2 gb file transfer and was getting the max speed of  39MBs with the SSD connected through the usb hubAlthough when I did the same file transfer by directly connecting the SSD to the laptop port i got speed of 111 MBs So if you

Works with two devicesPositive review Almost good and usefulHissing sound  output from viSe TV Vijay salesAcceptable sound no hassle of chargingExcellent productNot good rangeVery good,Atlast  I connected successfully Working good But sound volume  clarity not adequate Durability to be assessed  Dear amazonin tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearlyManual printing also is bad I had to struggleDoes what it says Works well to connect two Bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop smart TV etc Can take a bit of time to pair two devices But the manual in the box helpsSound quality over aux cable too is good So even if you do not have a digital output or RCA you can still use it Bit bit flimsy and delicate But then you dont need to move it around everydayDisadvantage  the sound and video lag with distance while connecting Bluetooth with headphonesPairing with headphones difficult need to wait longFeels volumes lowI got this to addon to a highend system which traditionally doesnt have the facility However its often requested when guests come over I was using a Phoenix transreceiver but the constant need of charging and the single indicator LED made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application The optical out is connected to a dual ESS9028 DAC and the device used for transmission is the iPad AirThis lacks a battery which is a big differentiator This means it is not exactly portable and the form factor reinforces that feature It is intended to be a desktop unit and it comes with a reasonable set of cables The quality of the included cables is quite poor so its best to use something elseCompared to the direct input from USB the overall sound is poorer with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble Still this is being used in a highend system  I suspect with many lesser speakerampDACs it will be acceptable At maximum output the level is about 12dB lower than a direct USB connection to the DACIt is around the same as my Signature Acoustics unit which is 13rd the size but uses a battery and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature or the nice display which is handy if you are close byThe bypass is one of the highlights of this device it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough and allows you to use both BT and another optical sourcereceiver  though only either can be used at a timeThe build quality is average It is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards hence the thin cables supplied The onboard volume control is nice if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume I use the DAC remote It also has only 16 clicks so the control will be very coarse The display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low it is sufficient for the tasksOverall its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices The sound quality limitations of BT transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols so Id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an addon for a hifi system For more normal usage there are cheaper options availableExcellent productBluetooth range is very lessBought it to connect my old Sony 51 blueray home theater with MI 4k box which does not have Optical sound port It has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical

Whole Review For All the Details  Decide YourselfGoodFul HIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BASEAmazingGood,Realme Buds Wireless design and  specificationsTruly wireless earphones are becoming very popular and we could very well see Realme get into that space in the coming months However for now the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form  neckbandstyle earphones The headset has a flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends short cables that lead to the earbuds and the plastic earbuds themselves We quite liked the yellowandblack colour scheme of our review unit The design is simple and the build quality is decent The device is light at just 30g and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at a stretchLike earlier Realme earphones the Realme Buds Wireless have magnets in each earbud While they dont serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the Realme Buds Wireless Separating the buds turns the headset on while attaching them powers it down there is no power button so this is the only way to control power on the headsetIn theory this sounds good but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket This would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didnt want it to which was bothersome Calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphones earpiece without us knowing the battery would run down and the phone wouldnt automatically connect to other devices such as a Bluetooth car audio systemWhat you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips ear wings that are preattached to the earbuds and a MicroUSB cable for charging The charging port is on the underside of the right module which also has the controls for playback calls and volumeThe Realme Buds Wireless earphones are powered by 112mm drivers with Bluetooth 5 and support for the SBC and AAC codecs The earphones have a claimed battery life of 12 hours on a single charge and are said to offer 100 minutes of listening time on a 10minute charge when the battery is drained We were able to get around 9 hours of use in our testing while a full charge of the headset took a little under 3 hours to complete  Realme Buds Wireless performanceThe Realme Buds Wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price Also fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the Realme Buds Wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular DJ Alan Walker and the sound does come across as geared for this genre the wireless earphones with use AAC Bluetooth codecs We listened to streamed music from Spotify and YouTube Music as well as our collection of highresolution tracksStarting with Take Five by the Dave Brubeck Quartet we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what were typically used to hearing from products in this price range Some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined although the deeper elements in the middle of the track  the doublebass in particular  was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as wed have liked Still we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the wholeNext we listened to a bit of Indian pop with an Unplugged rendition of Amar Arshis Kala Chasma Apart from some gentle aggression in the low end we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track The sound of the Realme Buds Wireless is tuned for comfort and nearuniversal appeal and sticks to that brief We heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than Rs 2000the Realme Buds Wireless as a handsfree headset for voice calls and results were mixed In some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft and our callers reported too much background noise  a crow cawing about 20 feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us for the person on the other end On other occasions no issues were reported so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal  VerdictMore expensive pairs of earphones such as the OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 and 1More Stylish Dual Dynamic Driver might offer much more by way of sound quality but the Realme Buds Wireless does a capable job for just Rs 1799 This is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the priceThis headset is built well has decent battery life and is very comfortable to wear The only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times That aside the Realme Buds Wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what its supposed to  no more and no less  with unwavering consistency and we like it for thatPros1  Looks good2  Light and comfortable3  Detailed rich sound for the priceCons1  Magnetic power switch is troublesome2  Inconsistent performance on voice callsRatings out of 5Design comfort 40Audio quality 38Battery life 45Value for money 48Overall 40Go and purchasedFirst of all if you are a ElectronicDance and HipHop Genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone STILL CONTINUES its not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphonesFrom My music listening experience from 8 Years i can tell you that the Depth and that vibrating Surround base effect is not in this  it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if youre a HipHop EDM lover THE MID TONES OF MUSIC ARE A LITTLE LOW IN THIS EARPHONE WHICH ALSO RUINS A LITTLE THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE GENRES SONG LISTENING EXPERIENCETHIS WANNA MAKES ME THINK EVERYTIME IS ALAN WALKER REALLY TUNED THISFOR TRAP  HARD DANCE GENRE ITS GOOD BUT NOT THE BESTI can tell you such differences because I am also using a wired earphone namely MI Earphones PRO 1799 rs which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effectRATHER THAN FOR THOSE GENRES SONG THESE EARPHONES ARE REALLY GOOD FOR EVERY OTHER GENRES If Youre Fine with the above listed drawbacks Then only head towards the detailed reviewUPSIDES1 THE MATERIAL QUALITY IS GOOD ITS PLASTIC BUT FEELS LIKE A SOFT SILICON LAYER IS APPLIED OVER ITS TOP LAYER BOTH ON THE NECKBAND AS WELL AS THE WIRES OF THE EARPLUGS2 THESE ARE EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT AND DOESNT FEELS A LIKE EXTRA LOAD ON YOUR NECK AT ALL3 NOISE CANCELLATION IS REALLY VERY GOOD IM REALLY IMPRESSED4 MIC QUALITY IS ALSO THE BEST THAT CAN BE OFFERED IN 2000 RANGE No Complaints5 THE EARPLUGS FIT IS GOOD BUT I ADVICE YOU TO REMOVE THOSE REMOVABLE ANGULAR PADDINGS FOR MORE SNUG FIT AND COMFORT IS FINE BUT COULD BE MORE BETTER AS MY WIRED ONES ARE REALLY MORE COMFORTABLE AND IF YOU HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THIS THEN YOU CAN ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT ITS COMFORT FOR LONG USE6 THE BLUTOOTH RANGE IS REALLY GOOD STILL WORKS IF 2 ROOMS ARE IN BETWEEN7 THE MAGNETIC ONOFF CONTROL IS LIKE CHERRY ON CAKE AND WORKS LIKE CHARMWHEN YOU SEPERATE THEM IT TAKES 34 SECONDS TO CONNECT WITH YOUR PHONE IF ALREADY PAIRED BEFORE AND IF PHONES BT IS ON AND IF YOU ATTACH THEM TOGETHER THEY GO TO STANDBY MODE AND GOES OFF IF NOT OPENED AGAIN WITHIN 5 MINUTES ITS REALLY GOOD THAT YOURE GETTING THIS MAGNETICFUNCTION IN THIS PRICE8 SOUND CAN GO REALLY LOUD BUT I PREFER TO USE IT ON 6070 9 MICRO USB CABLE  2 PAIR OF EXTRA EARTIPS SMALL  LARGE ARE PROVIDED IN BOX MEDIUM IS PREAPPLIED AND IS PERFECT NEARLY FOR EVERYONE10 BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD EXPECT 8 HOURS OF CONTINUOS PLAYBACK ON 70 VOLUME11 CHARGING SPEED IS ALSO GOOD YOU CAN EASILY GET 1 HOUR OF PLAYBACK ON 1O MINUTES OF CHARGE AND CAN FULLY CHARGE IT AROUND 90100 MINUTES IF FULLY EMPTY12 DID NOT GET TO EXPERIENCE ITS SPLASH RETENTION PROPERTYDOWNSIDES1 THE OUTER COVER OF EARPHONES ARE OF PLASTIC GOOD QUALITY BUT THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALUMINIUM FRAME IN THIS PRICE2 THE WIRES SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN AS BRAIDED ONE FOR ROUGH AND LONG USE3 NO REALME BRANDING PERMANENT ANYWHERE ON THE EARPHONE CONFUSES US BUT THERES TAG ATTACHED ON THE NECKBAND4 THE CAP ON THE CHARGING PORT SHOULD HAVE GIVEN TO PREVENT DUST FROM ENTERING5 SMALL CARRY CASE OR POUCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO MAKE IT TRAVEL FRIENDLY6 WHEN CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE WHEN THERE IS AN INCOMING CALL IT DOESNT RECITES THE NUMBER OF CALLER AND IT SOMETIMES DOESNT NOTIFIES AT ALL BUT NO MAJOR CON IS THERESOUND QUALITY1 THE VOCALS ARE REALLY AMAZING  NOW I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS OF POP SONGS 2 THE LOWS AND HIGHS OF THE SONGS ARE REALLY GREAT BUT MIDS ARE LITTLE SUPRESSED AND YOU WOULD DEFINITELY MISS THAT IN EDM AND HIPHOP SONGS as that evary low details are not required in dance songs the Mids  Highs are more important3 THE BASE IS ADEQUATE AND KEEPS THE SONG ALIVE BUT NOT PRODUCES THAT WELL DEEP AND SURROUND BASE THAT YOUNGSTERS LOVE BUT IT DEFINITELY HAS THAT AMOUNT OF BASE REQUIRED IN ANY SONG TO FEEL IT IM ALSO A YOUNSTER AND IM FINE WITH IT AS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND SERIES ON TV SILENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING MY FAMILY SO THIS FULFILLS MY PURPOSE4 THE BEAT AND SOUND PRODUCED FEELS NATURAL AND CLEAR LIKE HIGH QUALITY HEADPHONES AND IN THIS RESPECT ALAN WALKER AND REALME TEAM HAD SURELY DONE A GREAT WORK5 BASED ON TYPES OF MUSIC LOVERS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO POP INDIEPOP ACOUSTIC RB Rock and soft Rock TRAPHARD DANCE  NEARLY ALL KINDS OF GENRES EXCEPT EDM AND HIPHOPAS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE SO I DO NOT HAD ANY GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND I CAN SURELY SAY THAT IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS AND IM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASEPLEASE READ THE WHOLE REVIEW IT WILL SURELY HELP YOU DECIDE MORE CLEARLYHAVE A GOOD PURCHASING EXPERIENCE THAKYOU FOR READINGBest but little high price6to 12 month daily use he chal pata h The base is so loud you cant listen for long you will get ear pain after 1 hour Who like highhhhhhhhh base they can choose and sound quality ok Quality  is goodBest productGood product

GAMERSEarphone case was not thereBudget gaming and music earphoneOk goodProduct is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the descriptionproduct is good but not for this price,So about the product Boom ultima as it goes by the name it really got the ultimate bass effect Wires are great built and tangle free The audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well I just didnt find the case It was missing from my product Though they have given 2 pairs of extra buds with different sizes Overall its a great wired in mic earphones Go ahead and add to your cart You wont regret itSo first lets talk about the externalBulid quality is awesome 910 even at such an affordable priceLooksI have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWirethe wire quality is 910 I have these earphones from 4 months and these havent tangled since Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effectBut 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed so many times its difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easyNow about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice As you can see in my title Solid 810 You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when its time for a party you can listen rock bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap pricesBass quality is also goodperfect for the ears And if u want high bass I tried it with max bass it can produce and thats awesome But dont listen high bass for long Those can hurt ur ears really badBut noice cancellation is 410seems like there is no noice cancellation Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpieceObviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000 But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400depends on sale but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphoneIn past 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous there services are so cool and quick So those got replaced within 3 days its 3 days because I forgot the eslip if you mail them with everting ready it wont take more than 2 working daysIts an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these EditedTheir services are slower now Dont know why and it takes around 1 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund If something happens to ur earphonesAlso its been like 1 year as of 1921And I saw some trend with it My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 monthsIts not a problem though cause you can mail em regarding this This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphoneStill the best earphones you can find at this price pointNOT FOR HIGH BASS LOVERSEverything was OK but as shown in the picture that you will get a case along with earphoneswhich was not there inside itonly earphone and some earplucks were thereThis range very good productif your budget under 400 definitely you can bye this productNice productProduct is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also despite the return of first delivery of the product  for REPLACEMENT with pouchproduct is good but needs to work on noise

the earphones will start vibrating I have to tell youthe vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy like traveling in bikeor a busy streetBut remember if youre getting calls continuously itll less the battery backupSound quality Sound quality in these earphones are amazingThe mids are crisp and clear the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but its that not punchybut dont you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy baseThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone These earphones have noise cancellation which works goodthe volume level on these earphones are really highi cannot go beyond 80Alright So I have been using Boult ProBass Curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bulletpoints to make it easy for the prospective buyers I was thinking to buy a quality Bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended I was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then Moreover I found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling Its that time I started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search I took good time months to look for a good product And this is when I decided to purchase this item Before purchase I devoted time to read the users reviews that I always do before making any purchasesmall or big and found myself convinced Finally I decided to go for it Ok So no more essay writing  Let me get straight to the key points1 I bought this for 999 under Sale so saved INR 499 its a good saving As Warrent Buffet says every penny saved is every penny earned2 This has great sound quality I could not compare it against any other product because I dont have any other bluetooth headset with me  But this will surely not let you down It is very loud even at 80 volume level You just cannot listen to at that level forget about full volume Bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either Good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to 100 Excellent sound clarity3 I am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external soundnoise or very very minimal that is not noticeable So this stands perfect at this point4 Performs excellent while taking a call You will a get a crystal clear voice when you maketake a call using this device You will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone In fact its even better at times when the voice from the other side is low I really love the handsfree calling because I have to take long calls with the clients in my job5 Battery backup is excellent It can last anywhere from 10 to 11 hours I have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage And I mean it I tested it for almost a month with daywise log capture Please see the detailed tracking at the end It gets full charged in 2 hours approx6 Bluetooth range is good It covers a distance of 10 to 15 feet easily Its quite enough if not good enough My figures may be wrong Beware Its just my rough estimate Havent tested is rigorously7 Design looks good and is very convenient to wear The wires are adjustable as per need This is a nice thing Looks cool when you wear it around your neck I chose Red color8 Last but not the least It comes with 1 year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music Judgement Just go for it if you have a limited budget or dont want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset I was hesitant to spend anything beyond 1000 bucks on a bluetooth headset It was my personal limitationPS Battery backup log16 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the morning song play  WebEx call with Suneel17 May 1 hour

purchase a headphone I recommend for this one Under 1000 rupees best oneNo battery backup and no flexible to use they dont satisfied with provided featuresI am writing this review after used of 30 days the product is really very good sound quality durability battery performance is also very goodOverall its a fair productRs 899with all the featuresIts perfect for daily commute since it has a very good battery life it will last for 3 to 4 days easilyWhen it comes to the sound quality i feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious It would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product You cant have everything at once This is my personal opinion since i am a music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phonesOther than that its worth trying totally recommend this product if you daily travel for work and you are looking for a budget wireless earphoneSound quality is not bestI LIKED THIS PRODUCT ALREADY USING SINCE FEW DAYS BATTERY

charging backup Value for priceValue for moneyBluetooth service centre not availablegood quality,Writing this review after 10 months of usage First about the product itself  Its sound quality is very good Bass lovers will just love it Average mids and high  It lasts about 2528 hrs with a full charge Also tested on heavy rain while driving  dont worry  earphones were not plugged in  It was on my neck But there was no water ingressNow the major problem kicks in  After 10 months left speaker was not working So  I registered a complaint on boat website They picked my earphone for replacement  But later it was replaced with  rockerz 255 pro  instead of  rockerz 255 pro    Why  Even after a lot of conversations with boat support they didnt provide me my model  Now Ive to stick with these low quality ear peace Hence Try to avoid boat online support for warranty claim and better visit physical service entre Good luckEdit  After having conversation with higher authorities on Twitter they replaced the same with my model Edit 2  from first day onwards after receiving the replacement product I was in doubt that the sound quality was decreased a lot So again I replaced with the authorized service centre for flat  no very low bass  sound  But the 2nd replacement is also same I thought Ive some issues with my ear lol   But today when I listened to my friends rockerz 255 pro  same as mine but the retail unit I was surprised and thankful too  My ear was not damaged  It had the same punchy bass and that signature sound which was absent from my replacement unitSo I can conclude by saying the replacement product will not have that signature sound as the retail unitIf anybody has experienced the same please commentThanksI would recommend it very strongly if you want a budget friendly gaming earphone sometimes may feel a lag after purchasing but after some time it works very fine but it also has some cons like the build quality my earbuds gone worn off by normal daily use as well as there rubber quality is not that much good also mic it is not that good but it is okay so it is the best earphone under your budgetIf aman gupta is watching this review you may gift me a earphone thanks to amazon for such good deliverance of the products i have been using amazon for long time and amazon have truely win the trust of the customer Great product and once agian thanks to

shaped housings and angled at 45 degrees They do not fall out of the ears easily even during intense activities The silicone tips are nothing to write home about but that is expected considering the priceThere is a threebutton inline remote with mic located right below the right earpiece which can be used to answer calls control music playback and trigger the voice assistant on your smartphone The buttons themselves are quite mushy and difficult to distinguish between by touch aloneXiaomi Mi Earphones performanceXiaomi claim that the Mi Earphones feature a 3rd generation balanced damping system that creates a transparent sound and metal sound chambers created via a 20step process Marketing fluff aside how do the earphones really sound Simply put surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for twoWhile most earphones in this price range have overinflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range the bass response on the Mi Earphones is controlled and restrained It doesnt overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs That said bassheads will be left slightly wantingIts surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix although they do get overpowering sometimes The mids are slightly repressed which is evident in vocalheavy genres such as blues While the clarity on offer is decent for the price songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy This is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bassThis earphone set is fantastic And highly deserving of money I used it for a while last in 2022 and now Im buying it once more in 2023 In my perspective the Mi headset has good music and is easy to usegood goodNice productGentle bassNo loud soundProduct quality is decentDont expect heavy music experienceIts sometime uncomfortable but its fine i can adjustSeriously if you are a bass lover then you can go for itBut its built quality is not good it will damage automatically after 34 monthsit is not suitable for rough usesGot it for less than 300rs Not disappointted at allIf you compare it with other

JBL CS100 vs Sennheisers cx180  DETAILED Comparison after 1 YEAR of USE,For those looking for a genuine review  a brief comparison summary between the best three earphonesheadphones in the budget segment Lets help you to makeup your mind The review is for Sennheiser 275 S earphone but items for comparison are1 Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone 2 Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone3 Sony MDRXB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones  Just for an introduction i would like to mention I am a dire fan for flagship Electronic goods  manages to fulfill my passion for the Taste of quality from time to time Now lets begin When you start looking for earphones or headphones Sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so The brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment I too started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power  excluding those insanely pricey onesRead some very good reviews of the Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional OverEar Headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought itFound it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks may refer my review of HD202 at amazon which were not upto my tasteNext Unsettled  I went to purchase these Sennheiiser CX 275 S in earphones and here are my observationsDESIGN   CONSTRUCTION a Looks  feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently then in the long runits sure to failb Wires which are around 12 m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use itc Comes with 3 different sized earpieces to snug fit different earanatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the bestd Inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fite Comes with a gold plated Lshaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf Comes with a small pouch  which for the most part was a useless accessory for me A case or box would have been more a more elegant option Squeezing the whole earphone into the lill pouch everytimenaah  feels primitive but then its my own two piecesSOUND QUALITY  PERFORMANCExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe sound quality is crisp  clear  with clear mids and crisp pitches bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug itin to watch some movie or NATGEO documentariesThe lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimesThe frequency response as per specs was 17 to 23000 Hz against 4 to 24000 Hz of Sony MDRXB50APJust to quote Sonys bass could get really deep  low with its 12mm drivers and neodymium magnets For purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony A little makeup wont Hurt   LOLSound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apexVERDICT xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Lack of a decent bass  extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of 1600 bucks For me Not worth itDETAILS  COMPARISON xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI happened to test the quality  performance of all the 3 renowned Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone  lastly Sony MDRXB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphonesBASS xxxxxxxxxxxxxxSonySennHD 202  SennCX 275S The extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels Cheap redundant or unpleasant to the ears Its a quality refined timbre  bass  not some low quality stuff HD 202 bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing othersSOUND QUALITY xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxExcellent on all 3 but Sony a bit appealing with its  phenomenal immersive bassBUILD  DESIGN xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Again SonySennHD 202  SennCX 275S Sonys wire were tangle free earphone pieces felt indestructible noise isolation was UltimateNext was SennHD 202 and least by any standards was SennCX 275SThe fragile design of the wires around Mic In sennCX 275 may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many1 SennHD 202 II might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issueBass is anytime better than SennCX 275 S but not as mesmerising as SonySound quality though is very goodcrisp and clear2 SennCX 275 S might be good for purists but even with its balanced Highs and midsSerious lack of bass keeps you longing for more especially if you are more into moviesgames and documentaries than musicMoreover its extremely fragile  always tangling thin wires  is a constant annoying feature3 Sony MDR XB50AP gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality midsIts indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wiresDo not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure musicIts a quality bass with frequency response as low as 4 to 24000 Hzadds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other twoProbably like a Super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy  full of lifeAnyways at the end of the day its your callkeep listeningNOTE There are thousands of reviews for this product but surprisingly theres hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180 so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review You get a  L  shaped connector in these earphones so note thatI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopicBUILT QUALITY  boAt  Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense Metal housing holds up good but colour sheds off after 56 months Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting JBL  Small round cables shredding off after 78 months of moderate usage Plastic housing doing great so farConnector is bent but not in perfect L shape so its quite pain to use while resting Sennheiser  Small round cables holding up good after 1 year of rough use Plastic housing has become slick as rubber coating on it has shredded off Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting WINNER boAt 225 COMFORT  boAt  comfortable enough when used while in upright position These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so Has very long earphone head JBL  Comfortable enough in upright position Slightly uncomfortable using while resting as these have offset opening Sennheisers  Comfortable in both the position These are apt for long duration usage WINNER  sennheisers cx180 LOUDNESS CX180  boAt 225  JBL CS100SI boAt  tends to distort above 75 level of volume JBL  Crystal clear even at full volume but has least sound level in all of three Sennheisers  tends to distort above 75 level of volume but has greater sound level of all WINNER  sennheisers cx180 SOUND QUALITY  Bass mids  lows  I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids  lows which are strong  Crisp But bass levels are different boAt  has average bass I am very disappointed with it since these earphones are marketed as bassheads JBL  has least bass of all I felt treble is high in these Sennheisers  ton of bass and when used proper eartips its just a treat for bass lovers WINNER  sennheisers cx180 SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL  boAt  I noticed in early few months quality over call was great but started to deplete after 56 months But its still good not as good as new Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side JBL  its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now Sennheisers  their NO microphone lol PNOTE boAt  JBL boths mics works with android and iOS perfectly WINNER  boAt 225 CUSTOMER CARE  boAt  1 Year warranty Had no issues till date so didnt got chance to check it But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences JBL  1 Year warranty Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center Sennheisers  2 Years warranty I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service centerNOTE I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service I would suggest this to all WINNER  sennheiser cx180 CONNECTIVITY All the earphones have 35mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devicesVERDICT I dont think I need to explain anything else now since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones To sum up I would say boAt 225 are good if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting then go for JBL CS100SI But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180Hope this review helps you make sound

productEar phone With JackNicegoodGood sound qualityValue for money,Recieved damaged product the first time the seller is very good and quickly replaced it for a new one Go for bassheads 242 if you are spending this much They are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable The angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is soso Infinity zip 100 and their own bassheads 242 are way better for soundI would like to start by saying Im not an audiophile therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product First off this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it its good enough that I will buy it a third time if need beUpon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds  There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement More on this laterComing to the ear phones itself its among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand It is very durable specially the plug part that connects to your phone many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones This is not the case with theseThe wire itself is made of rubbersilicon It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasnt showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphonesRemember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin I dont know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume personally this problem didnt affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breakerMic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience In my opinion I feel that the quality is average it wont blow anyones mind but it will deliver most of the time A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review the sound quality of the ear phones As I said earlier I wont be going into the technical details  I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half its total volume when listening to music The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much A point to remember as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones This becomes a double edged sword on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used The find unlike the ones find in lets say the newer Bose ear phones arent as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged timeLast but not the least there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red black and blue I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color This leaves out the red for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they lastPros1 No metal build2 Excellent wire quality and trendy3 Durable4 Above average sound qualityCons1 Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2 Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3 Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220 All suggestions are welcomeThanking you DwarakeshBest quality  I like boat earphone saund qualityOnly disadvantage  I noticed was this cant be use in USB phones  35 mm jack is provided so it can be  usedin Jack phones only NicegoodI used this headphone for travel Very lite and easy to carry in pocket colourful Sound quality is good The wire is thin so i feel cautious  While taking it from bag or pocketGd one Only thing is

appearing issueAfter 2 monthsRight bud is not performing wellGood value for moneyWorking as expectedBest at priceGood built quality functions need improvementProduct is good but battery not as expected,Update after 8 monthsUpdate 1 The problem mentioned in the earliest review is becoming more and more dire with time Now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half whereas left one keeps going so reducing one star Will contact them for replacement and update hereUpdate 2 Called service center they asked to bring it but am lazy I expected theyd replace at home Paid more attention towards the issue above The stable situation is that just after full charge right bud can go upto 4 hrs but left one always goes for 3060mins more and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems so I guess I can still use the buds but with certain restrictions  Will happily restore 5 stars if the issue stays stable for next 3 monthsUpdate after 6 monthsNo change in quality still the pack charges the buds like a boss During this period they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour very dangerous thankfully he couldnt swallow them full of saliva and whatnot and on another occasion I threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force undisclosed depressing reason due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached which I then reattached After all this buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day 1 I think these are pretty darn sweet deals Lack of volume control etc etc is all forgiven Happy customer Although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persistsOriginal reviewUsing for last 2 monthsI am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist But I hadnt used any tws yet so wanted to dip my toes and didnt want to invest much but also not something throwaway So settled for boult no boat etc due to their highly adultered sound signature since I have previous experience with it I like my music flat at studio quality More recently Ive been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance oneodio pro50 Go ahead and search it It is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fansComing to this twsConnectivity Right out of the box only left one was working after connecting to my iphone Maybe right one didnt pair correctly to left Did that reset thing as suggested which also took some effort but after that both started working and since then no issues I am using both my phone and laptop linux Ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another But perfect connectivity now I can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss which is greatCall quality is decent faced no disconnects yet and the other party is also ok with my voice but you cannot talk in a hushed voice you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand youFeatures Tapping is oddly sensitive I mean it responds even if I am adjusting the bud and not touching the central area but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to playpause I can get used to that though One thing track aage peeche is ok But these dont have anything which can control the volume Bummed on thatBattery Decent backup Its been nearly 2 months I use buds on an average of 23 hours daily and I just had to charge the main case just 34 times In an emergency I also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly I was happy to see that One weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left infact I can use the left one 2030 mins more that the right But anyways I put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low batterySound qualityBass frequencies Very decent bass Surprisingly great low bass songs like the humma song i wanna love you sound pretty good but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass lut gaye by Jubin doesnt sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature Overall for the most part you should be fineOther frequencies Ill review this from vantage point of studio quality signature For mids the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above but its bearable For highs initially I felt the presence a bit lacking which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks but after using it for a few days I started feeling alright in that aspect maybe some burn in God knows Also remembering that I paid just 1800 bucks for these I mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions so I think my mind wont be nitpicking then Ill soon be upgrading thoughOverall really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k CheersHey  This one item has a built quality is like a stoneand also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice thats the only disadvantage on this oneRight buds not performs well I am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manualBeen using these for a month now Cant massively complain the sound quality is decent enough may not be good enough for big music heads not enough bass and provides good noise isolation Very impressed by the battery life with the charging case and I use it every day If you can snag it on a deal for 1500 bucks its a fantastic dealMy only issue is  we cant change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click  Every thing else is fineBest at price and

this product 1 week ago on Amazon but then I got a defective piece the case charger was faulty so I contacted with customer care and they agreed to replace itafter confirmation of faulty piece within 4 days i recieved my replacement pack and this time its charging well hopefully I dont have to edit this and it stays with me for a long timeGood earbuds at low priceBass is good sound is highNo noise

long  listening But ok for upto 2 hrsNo highs no mids no lows But are stereo enabledOne cant expect a bose or apple quality at 4 of their priceSo finally justice done for the price paidIf one dont want to spend high one cant expect a better quality than thisMore often than not you find TWBs that are expensive or dont fit well or one has a problem with sound qualityBut at this price point these buds are exceptionalI bought them for use at night just before sleeping They dont come out of your ear making it comfortable to sleep with The sound quality is decent with no misses on mids and voice quality over calls is goodPros1 Overall sound quality is better than other brands Bass is good Go for it if you got for ears for some good listening The distinctions are good2 It is Comfortable and

comfortable for sporting activities Mostly fits well but comparatively slips easily than the traditional designed ones3 Touch controls are uneasy as the touch point is above the hearing pointSabhi

hopes as stopped working just after return window got closedI feel its not worth spending INR 5000  20000 this product is definitely the best in the market at this price rangeMy expectation with this product was simple to offer good noise cancellation and uptomark battery backup which is deliveredI have used it for the last 3 months except for a few fluctuations while listening to musicUsed it for calls and gaming and Im satisfiedLastly if you are looking for the purpose of calling this device and all others fulfil the requirement but in my experience of using different kinds of products I felt

899999then its a steal dealalso in regular price bw 12991499 its a good productSound quality is good Enough loud at 5060 volume Bass is also ok Whenever needed it produces punchy bass Overall balancedMic quality is good in indoor conditionbut in noisy environment you cant rely on this Recevier cant clearly listen to youYou can do gaming as company claiming low latencyi myself didnt test itNow about battery backupcompany claim it will give battery backup of 42 hours with case 6 hours in single chargeAdditional 36 hours6 times charge via case But in practical use it gives total 35 hours playback It will give around 5 hours backup on single charge of buds  5060 volumeif you only listen to music or watching videobut no call or gaming You can charge the earbuds full 6 times via case so additional 30 hoursJust one issue with its designsuit case type box  not easy to carry in pocket I would say its a personal preference If you are into good looksdesign then its not for youNow its regular pricing varries between Rs 12991499 In this price range also it is one of the best tws under 1500 I will tell why now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under 1500 Most of them sound almost similar difference is like 1920 They are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup  by youtubersreviewers 4850 hours of playtime is just myth Ive personally used TrukeAirbuds liteBuds F1 which is by far the most false promising brand claiming 48 hours of battery in their every twsbut only give 21 hours Even other tws of boatAirdopes 121 pro which claim 4045 hours playback only give around 25 hoursDefy Gravity Z claiming 50 hours only give 28 hours If you are impressed by their looks  huge battery backup and thinking to buy thoseyou will be disappointed after purchase Instead go with thisyou will not be disappointedI read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like PUBG and also it falls from ear while running And that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differenceBut a PUBG youtuber Recommended me this so I decided to give it a try after trying out myselfLet me provide the facts for youI have a boat rockerz 510 headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing 2x better in providing accurate sound in PUBGIts been 23 days I used it daily for 67 hours on full charge it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in PUBG it doesnt give delay as written in the comments it has a good latency better than what I had expected from the negative commentsSometimes though I faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because its either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faqguidehelp card in the box Im satisfied in terms of gamingFor sports like running I wouldnt recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that its safe from landing on the ground Im gonna try that please dont use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environmentPros1 The level of volume it gets to is just awesome it can get incredibly loud so if youre at the gym these are perfect2 Awesome Bass3 Noise cancellation is just great if you simply put them on without even any music playing u wont be able to hear things around u very well its great for places like Gym4 Lovely battery life Ive had them a week and only had to charge the case once that too for just a few minutes And the earbuds themselves leave them in case for just five min and youll be getting battery for a long long while5 They are very comfortable can be used for long periods of time6 Affordable7 The touch controls are very responsive tap to pause double tap right one for next song double tap left one for either rewind or previous song Can also pick up calls just by tapping8 Multiple ear coverings are provided with it9 Type C portCons1 The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc The bass is the highlight so its great for music but for movies or gaming you wont get the most crisp audio2 Some connectivity issues sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work this is occasional not a daily or frequent occurrence Edit after 1 month use its now a very frequent issue3 The mic quality is good if you are using your phone but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4 Sometimes on WhatsApp the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes Not an issue if you are the one dialing i hope its just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issueOverall I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there lol so Im very very happy with themHighly recommended for music andor as a more affordable option as compared to JBL

by BoAtGood Product but Not wellfinished at a Fair Price of 1599,As I browsed various multiple earphones in this range on a notsobusy workday break I came across this very featurepacked product It seemed interesting  and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it  ANC So I thought Id give it a shotFirstday impressions  its blown me awayExhaustive list of impressions1 DIRAC OPTEO Balanced sound with punchy bass Yeah and not booming bass Its so great and Im quite surprised it sounds like something youd expect at a higher price point  11 Soundstage As soon as the headphone is switched on it starts in battery saving mode Once you turn on DIRAC Opteo mode you can literally feel the space opening up All the instruments feel individual and sound separated Fireflies by Owl City sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you Its really great for the price  12 Treble and Mids Clean and clear The bass doesnt overpower them and feels just right The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments dont interfere with it Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great  13 Bass Punchy and tight I love how it fizzles in Bonfire by Knife Party and how it reverberates in Turn Down for what by DJ Snake Breakin a Sweatby Skrillex Zedd sounded tight and I discovered how well produced it is Lovers of tight bass this is your product2 Volume It gets really loud So loud that I cant listen to it at the highest setting But if thats your thing then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting but the bass is still pretty clean and loud3 ANC ANC is present but wont drown everything out Its a great add on but if youre looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero then this wont do that If you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes this will do the trick  31 Ambient Sound mode The opposite of ANC it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation Again you cant blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo but you can listen with lower volume near 25 volume and hear things around you If the ambient sound also increased as I increased volume it would have been amazing4 Calling Did a couple of calls With nonoise the other person said I sounded great I took a couple of calls in a local grocery store was pretty loud and the other end had no issue hearing me5 Buttons The button placement is easy and I didnt feel any issue getting used to the controls The simple manual explains everything in 2 mins so read once and youre good to go  51 To note The sound is best in DIRAC Opteo mode Every time you turn it on you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on Id have loved having it on by default Also every time I turn it on it plays a 34 second tune which could have been shorter Imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on Ugh6 Connectivity Once I connected it to my phone the first time it connects to my phone within 12 seconds of turning the earphones on7 Battery It seems to last long Ive been using them for about 45 hrs and its gone down about 20 Cannot say anything more yet though  71 When you take both the earphones out of your ears it doesnt auto pause like some of the competitors Annoyed that this was missed would have saved so much more battery if they did this8 Build quality I have a black version Its made with good quality plastic and didnt feel heavy around my neck It doesnt have metal anywhere and its quite simple I think it looks decent9 Exercise Need to test Will update laterIn summary an easy recommendation If you can overlook the small issues theres a great sounding featurepacked and long lasting device here at a great price 1010 would definetely recommendFirst I was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say its got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons bass is good vocals are much clearer in Crystal bionic mode ANC is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but dont except any more than that no issues with call enx is working upto its name battery is sufficient around 1214 hours if you mix up the modes Overall a decent all rounded neckband jack of all and king of noneAll other things such as sound quality battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly If I connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time It does not work many times If headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you wont be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop This is a big bug Please fix thisThis BoAt 330 ANC Neckband is very Good but needs improvement and fixesPros Nice Sound Quality while using Crystal Bionic Sound but its average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points Great Build Quality Its ANC  Ambience mode is good in this price range Its quite Comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting It has Dual Pairing which is very good but its not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing eg while receiving a call on one device the audiovideo being played at another device wont Pause you have to manually pause instead there wont be any sound output through that device Its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device as this is available on BoAt Rockerz 335 and a few different BoAt NeckbandsCons Its range is very low considering Bluetooth v52 I even have BoAt neckband with v50 which has better range Even a single wall coming in between 34ms can block the sound output Its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly 810 hours everyday with Bionic Crystal ModeANC enabled While using Dual Pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between And the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices This happened on the Replacement unit I received maybe its not the case with your unit Sometimes no sound is received while playing Audio from both devices I dont know if its wrong with my unit or every unitOverall this is a good and considerable Neckband under 2k if you want Good BassRich Sound Quality ANCAmbience mode and Descent battery lifeBut if your requirements mostly is Dual Pairing then this is not for you As I bought this considering Dual Pairing feature most importantly But its not really seamless in between Devices but still its the best possible available feature in this price range or even under 5k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficientAnother problem with Dual Pairing is that the media doesnt gets paused on first device if theres a call on the second one which is already there on BoAts few other Neckbands but then there is no MediaPause feature on them eg If audio is being played on 2 devices first device Audio will get paused if Audio is played on second device and viceversaSo do try it out by yourself Because its my personal experience with the Neckband maybe you get a better experienceThanks for Reading Happy ShoppingBought this one after using Rockerz 255 pro for over 2 years now Comparing this with that that one was ergonomically better felt snug in earsStandalone review of this1 Noise Cancellation is just alright not too great not too bad2 Sound Quality is definitely great and excellent with the Bionic Sound feature Kudos on that part3 Bass Quality is fairly good at this price point4 Holds charge for as long as advertised5 Overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky  cheap atleast on the funky grey one which I bought because it was priced lowestConclusionGood Product at a Fair Price ie Nothing too great but nothing bad

under 1kSound clarityGood ProductBuds are very good QualityNothingBudget FriendlyAmazing soundGood product,Updated  Overall you really get what you pay for They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it pairedIf you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesnt work This is starting to get annoying but maybe Ill get used to it Well seeThis is just day 1 review of these Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon Ill post updates later on Hope this is helpful for anyone interestedPackage  The packaging is quite decent for such a low price Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs  small and large Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction cardBuild  was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the caseComfort  This is very subjective and each ear is different Its one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if Im OK with the form factor for long hours The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they dont cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use One thing to note is that if you have Gandhi ears then the fit might be a little awkward  I should know My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions YMMVSound quality  I liked them Im no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation I tried my usual test at httpsyoutubeJ0a2PrcMQo and they fared quite well The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent I feel this definitely punches above its price pointCall quality  In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like youre inside a well Seems the mics cant figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality Overall you get what you pay for hereRange  max I got was around 5m Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess thats passablePairing  UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022       Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as wellHave to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenientI dont have a phone to test the fast pair features  Actually Im not even sure these support it Anyway the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a littleBattery life  Way too early to tell anything Will share my experience post one week and one month But they came around 80 charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case  Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done The earphones also have LEDs that blink red  white to indicate pairing low battery etcSync issues  None so far But have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the L and R earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price TWSes So will see if I face any such problemsThese are the primary areas that I am concerned with while evaluating any TWS so will share how my experience is after a while So far Im happy with themHi My name is AkshayI used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable moneygood in calling alsoeverything is perfectGood Sound QualityBuds are very good Quality With great noise cancellation featureWhen we received this order box is already opened like thisI was not expected at allwhat i dont like is the earpads sometime it came out dont

She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones Her voice volume level is not very high eitherBT pairingTurn off the headset press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button The headsets voice will say Bluetooth pairing Once connected it will say Bluetooth connected If BT disconnects the voice says Bluetooth disconnectedNext trackPress and hold the  button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute chime and load the next song in the playlist of any app I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track However holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play Buttons arent very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressedPower off just like power on hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn offVolume updown No audible feedback just volume increase or decreaseStatus LEDBlue when On and slow blinking when connected to bt When in pairing mode the same light blinks quickly

plugs fall out of my ears while talking These dont I use the smallest oneWhat does Sony offerA very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio Ive never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal Once placed comfortably drop the ear and let the ear canal seal inAudio App Its basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser It plays MP3 from your storage too My phone already has a built in Equalizer I dont use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat So all types of audio sounds greatFAQIs it flimsyNo but feels like you might damage it if youre not carefulDoes it really

or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the songBassVery decent and controlledVocalsVery clearTrebleSharp and crispLoudnessYou can listen at full volume without much discomfort But Id suggest not toI compared it with JBL wave tws100 The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq80 Better than boat airdopes30 better than OnePlus bulletsZAfter using it for a week i returned itheres my understandingPros1Music Quality mids and highs are well defined if u want u can add bass from EQ that also provides bass with quality not boomy and unsubtle2 Fast Pairing  pairs instantly3 Hardware Level EQ  u can tweek it to your own desire4 Good Mic QualityCons1 NO MULTI PAIR SUPPORT ie u cant switch between ur lap and mobile instantly or in standby2 Cable Quality  The Provided Cable are so thin and fragile causes me to restrict my movements on wearing3 No Magnetic Tips for AUTO PLAYPAUSE If wear it to sleep it cant be turned off by simply removing and sticking it together like other neackbands  u have to use or phone or the buttons to pause the musicConclusion I returned it and bought realme neackband 2 though it was horrible boosted bass and mediocre sound Quality simply because of better features but i still prefer the SONY on music qualityGrip to the ear need to improveGoodThe product is well packed and tamper proof packed with Sony hologram in the boxConsThis is compatible with new edge Bluetooth version 50 so might not work with old phones like in my case with Sony R1 plus and xperia MWorks with Redmi 10 proin my caseThis is not exactly band but LR connected with thik wire which might fall if jumping or during workoutSound is 10 lower to Sony wired headphonesProsClear and balance sound with Sony quality music hearing experienceBase feels sufficient and clear not like uncomfortableThe connecting wire instead of hard plastic band makes it light flexible and weightless to wear and packing in the luggageMic clearity is 100 pure and your voice is very clear and sharp to the front personnot like othersIts complete value for money as this is perfect in its quality which many brands in this price tag is not able to doThis can be folded and packed in 4Conclusion Go for it if you are riding and puting this inside ur collar not open else it will fly Not suggested for gym as it will fallFunction are smart and easy to useSimply it gives

stopped after 67 monthsVocals are good music is bit dizzy and there is a sound zzzzzzzzzz when everything is silent Superb,Technical SpecificationsHeres the technical information of Boat BassHeads 225 InEar Headphones The information provided below is as per the manufacturer Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz It Features 10 mm drivers Rated Impedance of 16 ohms Comes with 12 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable 35 mm GoldPlated LShaped Audio Jack 90 degrees Sensitivity  98 dB3 dBBuilt Quality  DesignI was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal It has a diagonal gridlike texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel  attractive appearance The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating it is a tanglefree cable  does its job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling Despite the metal construction Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight  comes with a microphone  LShaped 35 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal Overall the built quality is excellent for the price  seems very durable The ear buds have proper L  R labels and are clearly visible Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed outoftheboxAudio QualityTo ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit I used highquality MP3 files of 320 kbps  Lossless audio formats like FLAC  WAV For smartphone listening I used Poweramp music player  tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability For the computer I used iTunes player  VLC Audio player I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod iPhone  Sony MP3 Player All this went for more than 10 days  finally I had my resultsBoat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed they really are very bassy as compared to others During my tests with them I found that the audio quality is very good for the price the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals they were clearer than before but overall average The treble was again very good the highfrequency sounds were clear  pleasant to ears The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent When listening to music the overall sound quality is amazing you can easily distinguish between different instruments  sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphonesNoise Isolation  ComfortWhen it comes to Noise Isolation Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it They come with medium sized ear tip preinstalled which seemed perfect for my ears once the earphones are on I wasnt able to hear outside noise they sealed my ears completely  delivered an immersive experience Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation  comfort Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff  somewhat awkward when used for longer periods Since the housing is made up of metal you may find them popping out every now  then when used during running jogging or any other sport or physical activity this didnt happen as often for me but for a friend they keep popping out every now  then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks they were a bit uncomfortable initially but as I got used to them they were fine plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on themFlat Cable  MicrophoneThe cable is great I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free  comes with a rubberized coating The cable does its job well The microphone is again exceptionally good it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise During calls the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick upreject calls on the go without taking your phone out It can also be used to control music which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225Warranty  PriceBoat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe in case you need it for warrantyFinal ThoughtsIve personally used Boat BassHeads 225 InEar Headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and Im pretty much impressed with them Im personally a fan of Extra Bass IEMs and currently my primary IEM is Sony MDRXB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category Comparing Sony MDRXB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didnt disappoint me obviously it doesnt stand a chance in front of Sony MDRXB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225  the quality they offer I was really very impressedBoat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices  music players I can say that theyre amazing for the price a pure steal deal The bass output is amazing and is very intense Ill recommend using correct size ear tips  good quality music player like Poweramp Android for better bass output The treble is good  vocals are average somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results The mids are again averageMy Rating  4 out of 5The VerdictTaking everything into account overall Im very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225 The Built quality is amazing the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass  good overall soundstage Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals mids  highs Overall the vocal  highs are good  mids are average but still good for the price Ill recommend these IEMs to bass lovers  budgetconscious people who are looking for high quality  durable earphones at a reasonable price Genres like EDM Rock HipHop sound really great on them Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price rangeHOPE I HELPED YOUTHANKSYes so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500 Yes you can consider it to buy But there are few points to remember before buy From my user experience I can tell you this1 This is not comfortable at all It slips from ear mostly You feel pain in ear after using it2 Never buy this for ONLINE CLASS as it is not possible to wear it 68 hours straightly3 After switching from Boat Basshead 172 I feel that the bass is not good as the previous one I dont know why It should be better4 Sound dont explode or go outside of the buds to 50 as it go outside on Boat 510 headphone so its good5 Feeling heavier on ears Not as comfortable as Realme Buds 2 Though both are metal build For balance sound you can buy Realme Buds 26 Buy it only to listen music not for too long time Do not consider it for Online class and Long time wear session  Hope it helped you Its just my opinion from using Boat 225 Boat 172 Boat 510 Realme buds 2 Mi basicIts a very good product but i dont recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head they will fall off easily with the slightest motion you will soon find it annoying Sound quality build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate youRaat me apne Babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta hI purchased the product a year agoIt worked fineI love the sound qualitybut you may not expect it to work after a yearMy headphone doesnt work  now properly My warranty get expired so I have to buy a new oneGood buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 67 monthSound quality is above average  but I got 15 years old manufactured ear phones build quality is as per cost  cant expect much  there is buzzzzz sound when music is silentThe earphones sound is

sound quality is good but not better than wired or neckband earphonesOverall GoodNice productGood to buy for compact ear pods with decent sound battery and sound qualityGood Good,Review after using it for about a month pros battery backup is the most amazing of all sound quality is amazing but bass is on the low side build quality is well made almost feels premium but could be improved very comfy even after a long day usecons Theres a noticable delay in touch controls most irritating one Theres no such thing as no delay during gaming on wireless earphones just get wired instead of this if you are planning on using it for gaming Noise cancellation calling or enc doesnt work also while calling 2nd person most of the time says that I cant hear you well or Your voice is so low on outdoors Sometimes a earphone doesnt turns on so I have to manually turn it on To pickup a call one tap but heres the catch to disconnect a ongoing call I have to double tap on the touch panel boat says single tap thoConclusion  If you have a little more budget dont buy this else this just works fineI recently purchased the boAt Airdopes 181 inEar True Wireless Earbuds and have been using them for the past week Overall I am satisfied with the product The earbuds are comfortable to wear and have a good fit and the sound quality is impressive for the price pointHowever I was disappointed to discover that the earbuds do not have noise cancellation as advertised While they do block out some ambient noise they are not as effective as other earbuds Ive used with noise cancellation technologyThe battery life has been satisfactory The earbuds last for a good amount of time on a single charge and the case is convenient for charging on the goOverall I would recommend the boAt Airdopes 181 earbuds for those looking for a budgetfriendly option with good sound quality Just be aware that they do not have noise cancellationI am writing this review after two days of usage1 Sound Quality The lows are good and pleasing to the ears Bass quality is good I just felt like the treble is a little too high which makes the high frequency music sound a bit unpleasant Overall the quality is okay but not as good as a wired headset or neckband earphones Kaam chal jayga2 Battery Backup Its been 2 days and I havent charged it yetstill showing 70 of battery remaining So I dont think battery backup would be a problem moderate usage3 Built The case is small and handy It feels sturdy The buds fit well in the ears Overall built is good4 Latency This ones for gamers I am actually impressed by the low latency it has Even without turning on the Beast Mode the feedback is almost instantaneous And after turning on the Beast mode it becomes flawless I played BGMI and COD and didnt feel any lag in the sound5 Calling I tried calling in a silent atmosphere and there was no problem faced Will update you guys if there turns out to be a problem when calling in a crowded areaIn 1399 rupees it is a good earphones Good battary life good sound good connectivityCons very poor build quality feel so cheap If you r a choosy person then you dont like the productIf youre looking for wireless earphone under 1500 go for it This product is good the sound leakage is there no doubt but you wont feel any sort of distortionthe airdrops 181 are very handy compact in size long lasting battery for its size and the connectivity is is pretty good along with the sound quality  though it has a room for improvement in noise cancellation but still performs very well for this price pointIts a good product sound quality is also agood but noise cancellation is averageIt is good product but only for 45

quality ear budsGood but is it worth itBluetooth range not that goodExcellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flawBluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark,The earphones have good clear sound quality It lacks base Battery backup is good ANC is a myth in this earphone It might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your earEat easily fit in ears and light weight and sound quality is good too Over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile tooBought this solely due to its form factor  to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style To be true Samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique TWSThis is not an inear style TWS but resembles somewhat earbud style TWS only of its kind in the market as far as my Knowledge goesThey are held very good in my ears gives me a good seal and does not fall out strange as I cant use earbuds because they fall out frequently It seems that Samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework However it doesnt mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globeThe finish build and all such generic factors are top notch  The size of the buds and the case is very smallNow about the sound If the buds fit in ones ears with a good seal the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect it may be tinnyThe sound signature is very bassy for my taste and I have to eq it to my taste The bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble I listen it in TREBLE BOOST mode adjusted through the app ANC works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable In contrary ANC ON somewhat opens up the sound Dont buy this for ANCStrangely to me these buds sound better on my iPhone 12mini than my Galaxy S22 Spotify and Apple Music The buds have app support for both Android Galaxy wear and iOS Galaxy Buds Live but the Android app is more feature packed and works better  The iOS app couldnt update the firmware although there is a Menu in the app and always showed the device to be on latest firmware However  as soon as I connected with my S22 on pairing  the first thing it did was to update the firmwareI love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 44K against an MRP of 16K The do sound very good but does not suit my taste  Persons loving bass may love them Dont get them for ANC Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok It has wireless charging too If your ears are too small or too large than normal  better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper sealBest call quality Noise cancelling could have been improved to best but still wotks goodDescent battery lifeMusic is good Not to that top notch but good in this segmentOverall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but goodI am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its priceBluetooth range is not that goodThe sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat I got these for Rs5290 it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance It feels like I am using bluetooth v30 The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket the audio starts stuttering The mic quality is a hit or miss inside the house it works very well but outside it performs poorly I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphones quality If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product Even at Rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue It is better to buy a wired IEM atleast it will sound better than thisIn this price Samsung brand is goodEasy to wear and good battery backupHardly support the 2 meter Bluetooth

good in this price rangeWork with teams perfect budget headphones,Sound quality is ok noise cancellation is not Upto the mark volume is good Overall for the price its worth product The cushion on the mic comes out easily  couldnt have been fixed properlyGoodThe built design is ok for the product Everytime i wear and do the resizing my hair gets stuck in the band which is irritating Rest sound and all is goodI stopped using it after continuously using for 3 hrs for office use It can not be used for long duration calls or back to back meetings Ears starts paining after 23 hours use Speaker cover is very thin I will give this device to someone needySound quality and built quality is nice but comfort is huge issue with this device due its tight overhead band It keeps both sides on ear for getting better sound or noice cancellation But the one who is looking for noice cancellation will buy over ear bigger headphonesI use all types of headphones overear onear earbuds Earlier used Sennheiser onear headphones but it never gives painIdeally if anyone buying onear simple headphones then it is for calls or meetings where they still want to hear sound in their room Some attention to sound in your room for example keeping an eye on kids while being in meeting Basic padding or multiple layer soft covers for onear will be helpfullGuys go for iBall rocker overear or HP overear wired headphones for long duration office calls It cost less compare to this Logitech deviceHowever this is still good buy for upto 60 mins use for 1 sessioncallmeeting and then a break Only issue for people having back to back meetingsNice qualityI bought this because I had to work from home and had to take calls My only worry was the noise cancellation because I live next to a busy road And I am happy with the purchase as the noise cancellation is working great People on the other side of the call have never complained about any kind of background noise The plastic quality used is great and its not squeaky The wire is long enough The sound output is good enough but I dont intend to listen any music on these If you need something for music then this is a wrong productCon The cushion is not adequate and starts hurting the ear lobes within 5 mins I had some extra cushions so I added those over the ear pieceBuild quality is not that good but sound qualitynoise cancellation is best in the range of less than 1000After covid19 our life changes a lot Online meeting conferences webinar even online classes became new normals In this situation a good headphone with mic is necessary for

quality is goodEar cuffs easily detachableDecent for the PriceBest one in this BudgetBluetooth is connecting should be improveGood ProductNice product,I have used boat 900 boat 400boat 550 and i go for a 1st time with zeb thunder pro actually im a music lover and i expect more sound quality bass thump and rich music feels  trust me below what i quote hereBoat 900 is a budget segment wired type less than 800rs its overall massive performance looks quite simple but gives extra bass overall worthAnd boat 400 900rs is discomfort because of over tight pressure in ears  i hope by long days its become looseby the sound its gives a pinch more than extra bass than boat 900  and looks smart here sound is more and bass thump is very morebut here voice or somewhat looks bassy not suitable for online classesits only use for music loverBoat 550 is around 1800rs its only suitable for online classes for voice no thump or bass at level totally very mild sound with clear vocal dont expect bass or beat here and i met agreat issue is its over ear headphone and its make sweat my ear and make my body temp increaseNow zeb thunder pro  699rs for this price its a great product  classy look sd slot and so But here some negative points also hereButtons or not sturdy some what loose and body parts are like head band are toy plastic for music full volume is very loundness not lovely to like make a shout punch in a ear painfull bass is also very good but overall its always below tha boat products im not a hatter  but if u used a boat product u wont like it same that if u use sony u wont like boat  If u use no other brands and  zebronics 1st time u become lover to this still im surprise how they give this product for this price shocking  aux  type C  under 700 is shocking bcoz if u go for boat type C product is 1700 aboveZeb or not bad its more ok for this priceSound 45  heavy loud in full voume looks shouting inside ear  otherwise niceBass  375 Not reach boat product  but u wont feel diff if u use for 3 more daysMusic  sound   vocals i cant separate in this productDurability 385 bcoz they used toy plastic in band but however not easily breaks compare to boat 450 its strong onlyOverall i look for a aux  type C  best bass effect so at last above all are not reach my concern now i ordered zeb bang pro699rsIf it also sound loud thing then i shutdown with boat 400 900rs segmentNote if i get boat 660 in initially  i wont go for these alllllll Bcoz unbeaten and full fil my all expect thanknuSound quality is good built quility is ok as per pricing  I got it for 600 rs totally worth it Its been more 10 days since i am using Its working totally fineSound and other qualities are doing well except ear cuffs are getting detached easily and no firm support for themPonsThey are good for the price they come Sound is decentBattery life is long enough for 2 days not countinouslyThe wired features is a charm if battery goes dead Noise cancellation is also decentComing to the bad pointsBuild Quality is a  little Cheap according to the price  the hinges shouldnt be used that much it will lose its gripAlso the Bluetooth is not that grt  if you are on a vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any songThe connectivity is a issue The dual connect is good but their is a latency of about 23 second when switching from one to anotherThats all You can buy this if your budget is less and as a student this is the best headphones at this price rangeSound  Great Bass Vocal and Instrument Seperation  Average  To be expected like this for this priceConnectivity Fast BT connectionBT disconnects when AUX connectedComfortable to wear since its over the earAverage build qualityOverall 45I like this product I use it everyday while travelling to

this headphone Just like fall in love ye kuchh jyada hi ho gyaGood quality,UPDATE20012018Its been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400 Some of the dislikes Ive mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but Im quite used to it and Im loving it  the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong You might ask why Here is whyAfter a long gap I visited my Father who is an audiophile He has numerous highend headphones but unfortunately he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it I said yes I regret it   he paired it with his device and played a song Boy you got to see the grin on his face D He said Im keeping it you buy another one Poor me was forced to buy another one A few days back I got another one One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD Both my audio cable had the same issueSo the moral of the story is Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother they will unceremoniously snatch it from youJokes apart people you cant go wrong with this purchase Its worth every square inchHappy ShoppingEND OF UPDATEI got this product 3 days back and I got it for Rs 1299 lightning deal of course This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the productThree days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I cant help the excitementLikes1 Good built quality  45It is sturdy for the price the build quality is great It is not flimsy The ear cushions are good enough2 Sound quality355If you are an audiophile this is not for you Bass is decent nothing to go overboard as noticed in other reviews Bass is deep enough for the price3 Connectivity pairing is easy connects like a breeze 454 Dual Mode Wired and wireless Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cableIf you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone  I couldnt find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though   I absolutely loved this feature 55Battery backup Im impressed with the battery backup of this beast Ive been using it for 3 days for 23 hrs a day still its running So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume its true So far so good will update it after a months usageDislikes1 Sound quality is more on the flatter side When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep You wont get that ambiance Boats website saysDont just be loud be loud and clear Nope sorry Ive to disappoint you on this When its loud its not at all clear A lot of distortions are there when you are loud2 Comfort Believe me its not at all comfortable for prolonged usage Your ear will beg you to take it off after 3045 mins If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1120 hrs If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman3 Range Boats says 10 meters range In my experience if you go beyond 56 meters then the voice will break You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that And Im experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I dont know whether it will be a problem down the line Will let you guys know about it later if its a problem 4Flimsy aux cable I cant complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind Remember I paid only 1299 for it But with certain devices the aux was not working properly Mi note 3 had issues Mi 4 also had issues with aux Not sure whether its the problem with my device But it worked flawlessly on my laptop5 Wafer thin service centers Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you cant find any service centers near you This is a hit or miss guys6 Voice cancellation I didnt find this effective Maybe its just me not sure7 Microphone is pretty much useless You cant make calls with this headsetSome alternatives These are all wired headphones comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you1Sennheiser CX 180 Street II  I dont think Boat can beat this ones quality The sound is incomparable the base is deep nice fidelity nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired inear headphone I own 2 of this beauty Total value for money If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I cant a better alternative than this2 SoundMagic E10C InEar Headphones with Mic BlackGold This is another TVFM earphone3Sony Extra Bass MDRXB250 OnEar HeadphonesDont buy it1 If you are an audiophile  obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones D 2 If you intend to use it for long hoursBuy it1 If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance2 If you require a wired and wireless package in oneVerdict Id give this headphone a score of 375 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hasslefree Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you wont regret it you wont be disappointed In this price range I couldnt find any other headphone with such a performance We dont have many options Do we  P PThe actual price is Rs 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57 discount pls dont fall for that I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphoneNote Im not an expert in this field This is just a lay mans reviewThank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decisionMy boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV Laptop and my phone I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola i chanced upon thisValue for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs then it is a very good dealits difficult to let go of  my boat headphones  i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale  the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year  i know this would happen  and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in  ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again  but later the top headphone band broke off  i used a fevistick to stick it up  and used it  i stretched it even further but it broke again  but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far  its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product  still trying to stretch it further  if it doesnt work  i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product  and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality  theyve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays  evolutions aside  i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and its still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall its very good purchase for meDont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth itI recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable The battery life is also impressive with up to 8 hours of playback Overall Im very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphonesUnder 1300 rs it is best head phone sound quality super bass good noise cancelation not bad product weight not heavyNice headphone nhibole to jhakasSound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that hhh

YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you wont regret it you wont be disappointed In this price range I couldnt find any other headphone with such a performance We dont have many options Do we  P PThe actual price is Rs 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57 discount pls dont fall for that I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphoneNote Im not an expert in this field This is just a lay mans reviewThank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decisionMy boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV Laptop and my phone I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola i chanced upon thisValue for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs then it is a very good dealits difficult to let go of  my boat headphones  i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale  the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year  i know this would happen  and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in  ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again  but later the top headphone band broke off  i used a fevistick to stick it up  and used it  i stretched it even further but it broke again  but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far  its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product  still trying to stretch it further  if it doesnt work  i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product  and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality  theyve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays  evolutions aside  i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and its still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall its very good purchase for meDont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth itI recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable The battery life is also impressive with up to 8 hours of playback Overall Im very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphonesUnder 1300 rs it is best head phone sound quality super bass good noise cancelation not bad product weight not heavyNice headphone nhibole to jhakasSound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that hhh laalach karna buri chijh h hum sudhrenge nhi kabhiI think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai enjoyingGood quality easily connected my lg 4k smart

and stylish but too tight in usb port average performanceGood productSlowIt works everywhere except for car stereoONLY 57 GBGoodGoodNice pen drive,Got 2 of this 32GB HP v236w pendrives this morning Review is based on testing done the same daySummaryThe product is genuine and sturdy but the performance is just about average based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire spacePros  Cons comparing with SanDisk Cruiser Blade 32 GB Pros1 Solid body looks and feels great2 Read speed is fine 22 MBs3 Product is genuine covered under 2 Year manufacturer warrantyCons 1 Fits too tight in usb port thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully2 Capacity is 31 GB precisely 31042043904 bytes not 32 as advertised In windows itll show up as a 289 GB drive compared to 298 in Sandisk No big deal just a technical observation3 Write speed 33 MBs is not bad but slightly inferior to its close competitor Sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives 4 to 44 MBs for the same test4 Warranty is only 2 years compared to 5 years on Sandisk But since almost nobody claims warranty after 2 years and besides the plastic body of Sandisk gets physically damaged in 2 years anyway so its okay for meBottomlineIts good enough for casual users maybe chosen over Sandisk for its look feel and sturdiness Frequent users may want to look for better options with easier port fitting and better write speedDetailsThe product name is HP v236w as shown on its packing the images in listing are correct while its part number is FD236W32 so slightly confusing but both are the same thingTesting whether it is genuine or fakeThe bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with scratch and check written on it Scratching it reveals a 20digit code beneath it and the right edge of the sticker has the url wwwpnycomtw to verify this code Go to support  product authentication page on that url That page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get Mine were originals with the codes tested for the first time repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested beforeSo that means it is covered under 2 year manufacturer warranty as declared by hp for Aisa Pacific regionDesign and build quality  Sturdy stylish but with a design flawIt is exactly as shown in the picture The body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap The plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look though it may come off later The HP logo product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely wont be erased with time Overall it looks and feels great The flaw I noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like Sandisk You almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out This means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon or may even break it if not used carefullyCapacity  31 GB not 32 will appear as 289 GB in windowsIt is advertised as a 32 GB drive but the actual capacity is 31GB and yes Im fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference Im a hardcore linux user To be precise its exact capacity is 31042043904 bytes on both pendrives I tested So in windows it will show up as a 289 GB drive In linux it will show up as either 31 GB or 289 GiB binary calculation like windows For comparison my 32GB Sandisk shows up as 32010928128 bytes or 32 GB or 298 GiB This loss of 1 GB in a 32GB pendrive is no big deal for me just a technical observationPerformanceRead speed about 2022 MBsWrite speed about 33 MBsTested with  a collection of ISO files ranging from about 350MB to 4GB along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt Total size of the collection was about 302 GB 282 GiBI did this testing on linux so to be fair the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat32 that the pendrive comes formatted asEdit No performance difference on Windows either Formatted as exFAT on windows 10 to make it multiboot with YUMI Readwrite speeds were same while copying ISO files to it or reading them to load in memdisk while bootingI could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didnt bother as the difference usually isnt very significantUpsThe product is very good i mistakenly washed it 8n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new No data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yetDownsThe only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology 2032 is newer oneAnd second one is not affact your data at all the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning blackProduct is good but slowStorage is good but doesnt work for car stereo57 GB OUT OF 64So far so goodGood

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSanDisk is an IsraeliAmerican manufacturer of flash memory products including memory cards and readers USB flash drives and solid state drives As of February 2015 it is the thirdlargest manufacturer of flash memorySanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president  the CEOOn May 12 2016 SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US19 billion dealWHY A DUAL DRIVE WHY 64 GB  WHY SANDISKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the musclemerits or the key features of the device lets have a quick look upon my personal selection processDual Drive  Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized in todays comfortseeking world whos will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it then fit it in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement64 GB  This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage price  future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size64 GB ensures that you wont have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basisSandisk  In the recent few years Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization quality and brand image  offers the best value for money deals for an average usageMoreover could not find much reputed brands in the Storage with OTG featureA Note  Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version  should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend SamsungABOUT OUR PRODUCTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The device comes with the title SanDisk Ultra  Dual Drive m30 and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration Here I need to quote that the term Ultra came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed With a microUSB connector on one end and a USB 30 connector on the other the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones tablets with micro USB ports only or laptopsBoth the connectors are carved out of metal  the USB 30 connector is backwardcompatible with USB 20 ports SIZE  The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplacedThe USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 15inches when expanded at USB end CONSTRUCTION The device has a plastic body  the overall construction of the drive is just average The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and wont give up so easily Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief FIT  FINISH Being equipped with a retractable mechanism  being too small the drive is not so smooth to use  slidein or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving sizeThe USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy STORAGE FORMAT Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file  NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesnt have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well So our drive has only ex FAT  NTFS formats to choose  comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MBs to 15 MBs if thats a relief to anyoneThe format would surely work well with most of the TVs tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesnt work SPEED   The demerit detail    I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life  Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this  there were not many options for dual OTG device So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchaseMy basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 81 GB  it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher  it felt like waiting forever for it to happenEven for a single movie of 18 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer The write speeds started with 13 MBsec and went down  down to 1011 MBsec Even with my older Kingston DT elite 30 16GBthe write speeds were in excess of 21 MBSecI admit I have a USB 20 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever The tagline Ultra and mentioned speeds of 130 MBsec which I suppose is the rated max speeds at USB 30 ports felt like a dream and beyond exaggerationFinally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying Even in NTFS format speeds were the sameI had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018 thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement  not reversalI know that readwrite speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type format configuration of drive configuration of host  destination device etcBenchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MBs Read  19 MBs  write which looked like a mere consolation Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile  S2 tablet too was not fastVerdict  Yes my friends  all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as Ultraslow STORAGE  Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB  the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough WARRANTY  The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers PRICE  I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size Dual drive  brand image MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks  it was tagged made in Malaysia Only if it was a bit fasterFINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all in my personal opinion given the brand image Ultratagline  modern day technology advancements even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write ratesEven for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price It could have been a great allrounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk  5 years of warranty had its speed been any betterCOVERED HERE Actual storage space Heating Mobile Phones Tight Fitting on mobile phones Speed Formatting File System Value for Money Free App Company Brand SellerAbout Company Product  Seller1 SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external harddisk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable2 About 3 to 5 years ago WD Elements  Portable drives of 2TB and 4TB were priced Rs 1200 less than current day prices They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon3 Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon4 For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products5 Reason for higher prices for same brands same capacity storage devices may be various  such as import duties taxes manufacturing costs higher demand for the brand etcREVIEW SanDisk Ultra Dual 64GB USB 30 OTG Pen Drive Gold1 STORAGE SPACE Just as in external harddisk drives the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product2 SAME AS OTHERS For the 64GB pen drive actual storage space available is 572GB This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement This is because it has FAT32 File System Also the device uses some space for its functionality and use In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT32 pen drive is shown to be 615GB So thats 4GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System3 HEATING Even with just 10 minutes of use you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat This heating does not happen in WD external harddisks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands4 MOBILE PHONES The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well5 TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones  tablets  so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone  because this is also the charging point for your phone If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management6 VALUE FOR MONEY Even if you dont use this pen drive for mobile phone  it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 30 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers7 SPEED The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones8 FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE Unless you are sure you wont use your pen drive on a particular device dont format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File SystemBut For Example If you have decided that you wont use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you dont want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging  then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive With your Linux systems file format you will have better storage space than any Windows File System BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it wont work with mobile phones tablets laptops which dont have Windows Operating System Same way if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System it wont be recognised on Windows laptops Android phones tablets etc if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or coworkers then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is9 FREE APP Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive It is easy to install and doesnt take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access It is very useful App with easy userinterface App takes 64MB storage space on Android Phones Features include cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phones File Manager App Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One

moneyBest in this price rangeDetailed Review  Pros and Cons badhiyaBest Wired Headphones For Watching Movies And Online ClassesVery noiseAverage qualityNice experience in this headphone,Stopped working after a month of use Dont waste your money on this productEverything is best but build quality is avglets get directly into the Pros  Cons sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy thisPros The Price given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the Audio quality its superior for the price 499 i got for this price tagthen the Comfort everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears But this One has SOFT CUSHION like material im really comfortable with this oneand next the Audio Quality i have previosuly owned boult inear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality so i booked this without even thinking twice and it has delivered what it can the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my inear earphones the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets but the Bass and Clarity will give you some extra feel especially the BASS its really engaging if ur a Bass lover go for itthen the Quality i know the Boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or Sony coz ur not paying that much for this so for this price its so good even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tagNow Cons little skeptical about the Warranty because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult inear earphones they didnt asked for Invoice slips and No serial number is asked then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality Next is the Cable Quality i didnt complaining about it but they mentioned in amazon as its an Kevlar Cable so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its Sturdy enough i didnt check the mic on it i make a call on this the other person was able to understand me but i dont know hows the qualityTo Help you guys i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money coz every single rupee countsHave a Nice and Safe Shopping Byeachhi product heGot the product delivered unharmed in 6 daysI got it for 499This is the best branded product in this price rangeSound quality is pretty good considering the priceBass is good but the loudness is a bit low you have to listen them above the 50 level of your mobileClearity is very goodI bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purposeEar cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise besides they arent known for passive noise cancellationThe wire attached to the ear cups is a bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefullyI have attached a pic with side by side comparison of my old Boat Rockerz 400 which I bought for 999 in 2018 and they lasted for a very long duration of 4 yearsThe Boult Audio Q2 looks a bit delicate as compared to Boat Rockerz but dont forget theres a double price difference between themLets see how long it goesSumming up this is the best product in this price segment 500 Just go for it if you get the sameNoise level is so high I couldnt listen more than 5 minutes So I like to choose another brand please refund for this productQuality not as expected levelI use this product for mostly in gaming and listening songs but there are no mic in it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31IO--RzGbL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Boult-Audio-Wired-Lightweight-Comfortable/dp/B08FY4FG5X/ref=sr_1_371?qid=1672903013&s=computers&sr=1-371

operation button in television which is big irritate when the remote not workingIn simple words Please dont buy this MI TV and especially from Amazonthis seller Sold by Cloudtail India and Fulfilled by AmazonIf you have patience and able to understand normal EnglishI dont have writing skills to share exactly my feelingspain then please go through my following experiencefeedback to know why I said Dont buy itDont wanna give single star but not allowing this site to post without starReason to Buy Trust AmazonBy looking at the 43 out of 5 rating and 1 Best Seller tag I got interest on this TV As we have trust on Amazon and also as it was coming in my budget with good features I purchased this MI 4A PRO TVBut seems majority of good reviewratings are paid ones These are cheating us off course they didnt force to buy but being middle class personhuman being we may get attract to things which showing better in less price Seems this madegave opportunity to these sellers to cheat usAmazon Delivery Feedback I may not comment on all deliveries happening not safely but when it came to me its not delivered safelyThis TV came for home delivery in Troalley Auto without proper placementsafety asked delivery person why alone kept it while coming due to up and downs of road it may fly right He didnt listen my words simply said will take it back if any physical damageHe only open it and as outside nothing see damage Delivery person said if any inner damage during installation time Technician came to know and will replace it and he forced me to tell OTP to accept me deliver and leftTV Installation Feedback Did by Amazon Technician PersonInstead MI Technician Amazon Technician came and installed this MI TV I got it installed Stand mount as wall mount not freely providingTechnician somehow explained TV usage but thinking as not MI person not have full knowledge and exploring and telling each detailsHowever normal usage of TV this amazon technician help is fineTV ExperienceFirst day Having slight less picture quality and few showing pixels not as required for Eye safenessAfter 3 or 4 days Picture quality came better SoundAudio quality was good either on OTTYoutbe or Setup boxDTHUp to 11 days As we not used much and simply using it for watch DTH channels Everything looks goodAfter 12 days Amazon replacement time expired then started showing soundAudio problemTV sound coming very slow When installed timefirst 10 days if we set up Volume 15 or 20 it was able give bigger sound now though we increase volume 60 or 65 not giving the sound that we heard when it installedsetup Played the same content which we listen in Youtube when after installation completedRegarding this yesterday raised request online service person asked me to update build version to latest Now it is PL6036 but still have the same problem2 or 3 days ago while watching suddenly TV got turned off We did power off and on then it got switch on usually also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked But not sure what problem we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issuesNot sure seems as I bought from this Amazon or MI service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problemOnline service person instead sending Technician to home for verifying problem Told and did build version update with me to latest Software update Later he said Volume limit got increased to 100 now we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior ie Before if 1520 volume level gives big sound then now 5060 volume level the same sound Asked when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of Volume limit increase But he told OTTsome apps will show difference of this new feature at the time as I have been on this calls and worries got tired I said will see and get back to you with new requestAfter some time when I visited my friends better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem simply said some words to conveytired usOff course  I can hear sound at 60 or 70 Volume but my concern is after purchaseinstallation of 13 days only I got this problem in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruiseBeing middle class person we give value to single rupee also because we know how much efforts we put on to get that money After purchase of this MI product crying lot why we went to it instead we could have went for further good brand product though they high in costNow not replaced my TV or not did service by Technician We decided that we got cheated on and prayed God to take careBought two years ago My panel stopped displaying just one week before the warranty was to expire after two years They promptly replaced it with a new one I did not even spend one rupee extra  Hasslefree Highly recommend buying Mi products The product is also

productGoodVivid picture quality is stunningSUPER DEALValue for moneyVery nice,NOTE If you select brandauthorized TV installation then DO NOT unbox the tv until MI representative arrivesThis ensures that if TV is damaged in transportation then you will get replacement easily If you didnt choose installation then just SHOOT the video of unboxing by yourself to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed Amazon Prime and Netflix are not inbuilt but can be Sideloaded  To use your Set top box with android interface you need to buy MI IR cable and set it up OR else directly connect the set up box via AV or HDMI port to use it conventionally Out of 8GB memory you only get around 47GB free to use check the image attachedThere are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube but NONE explains the TVs potential completely and what its actual flaws are Heres a quick Fact for the Users complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees  here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K So just check once what options you have before complainingEventually I bought this TV since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks I am stating my DETAILED user experience Its a detailed  huge review but do read it if you want to invest this much amount If you want to get quick overview of the device then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review  Firstly its budget friendly  ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market Has Most number of Output port  1AV 3HDMI 2USB  Has Android 81 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth Has Dual interface  MI Patchwall  Android TV  I mostly prefer android TV interface  Remote has Bluetooth  Voice Search with sleek profile Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM  8GB storage  47GB actual  Speaker Output is low Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface Amazon prime  Netflix is NOT preloaded but can be side loaded Native Display is ONLY HD though 1080p  even 4K videos from youtube works well check images attached Can install  play tons of High quality games like RR3 etc check images attached Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the timeFULL DETAILED REVIEW BUILT QUALITY  Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body Its not great but above average Table top stands looks bit flimsy but are workable The screws which are provided in the box DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly so I bought new from local store It has averagely slim profile not the slimmest in the market Speaker Placement is inconvenient Since they are placed at the bottom so when you keep it on table top the sound tends to dampen and bulge Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up Overall built quality is above averageDISPLAY QUALITY  It has very Thin bezels which looks great Video resolution is 1366x768p but 1080p videos works fine on it 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well Viewing angle are good compared to price  Check the images attached  Contrast is above average Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid Display quality is also above average not very greatREMOTE CONTROL  Its very sleek and compact Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate Fortunately it has Volume buttons which is handy  I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume P  Placement of Voice search button is improper Its just below Power button and I end up pressing power button a lot Finally its bluetooth so no need to point it towards tv for operationOTHER FEATURES  It has Dual interface ie Patchwall and android TV  Has tons of content Many games can be installed till you have memory left including multiplayer games Google voice search is very useful if you dont want to use keyboard Processing speed is fast and I havent detected any lags yet  Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed not due to hardware  Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectlyCONS  Speaker output though rated 20W is NOT upto the mark My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound Placement of speaker is inconvenient as in table top position speakers face the table and sound dampens Internal Memory is very LESS NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded though you can side load them Miracast not supported Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes Native resolution is just 720p HD though the 1080p videos works on usb  4K on youtube Screen is Slightly reflective its similar to almost all the other LED tvs Mixed experiences of after sales serviceCUSTOMER CARE  Firstly the installation is a Joke My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is theres ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product P Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative so theres NO point of return window time frame MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpfulVERDICT Considering all the facts if you are fine with above average Display quality want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget then this the TV you should certainly go for Trust me you wont get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months If you have higher budget then certainly explore brands like sony samsung etcThis is NOT a perfect smart TV but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty its NO brainer to choose this its certainly worth the investmentThis television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of 12500Performance The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media supportPicture Quality Many people complain about the overbright screen But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settingsThese are my preferred settingsBacklight 1 to 20During night even the lowest value of 1 is  bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyesDuring day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions A maximum of 20 would be enoughSetting backlight to minimum improves black levels reduces power consumption increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during nightBrightness 48Brightness setting controls black levelIncreasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrastBrightness at 50 pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationAt 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of detailsContrast  40 to 45Contrast setting controls white levelContrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45 Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed As the screen itself is very bright increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrastSaturation 45 to 50Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50 At 45 colors look more natural At 50 colors looks a bit punchy But still its a personal preferenceAt the above settings the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p  The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TVLG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black DemoLG OLED Eclipse 2 DemoLG HD Demo Art NouveauFull HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named Life Untouched and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good detailsScreen Quality I think this is a VA panel  the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels The screen is glossy and hence reflective This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing itLike all other LCD panels this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but thats only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds While watching movies or other content its not at all a problem Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etcLuckily theres no backlight bleeding in the unit  I receivedViewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but thats a common VA panel characteristic IPS panels with good viewing angles cant be expected at this price pointAll LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels VA panels excels in black depth despite its average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levelsSound Quality Bass is a bit weak I think bass is improved following some updates So giving 5 stars from 4 Its very loud even at low volume Midrange and treble are very good Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearlyEditIn a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good But it isnt100Hz  7300Hz  81000Hz  43500 Hz  610000 Hz  5A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffledThe following settings sounds much better and heres the reason100 Hz  8  BassFrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick DrumToms Snare etc300 Hz  4  Low MidrangeEnhances bass and depth of male vocals Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 Hz  3  MidrangeImparts a metallic tone Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant3500 Hz  5  Upper MidrangeVocals especially female sounds best at this frequency A value of 5 enhances vocal quality Increasing too much makes vocals harsh10000 Hz  7 TrebleAdds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments Enhances tinkling  sounds of metallic  instrumentsHuman ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here its 1000 and 3500 Hz Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue Even increasing 300Hz is disturbingGreat sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget But considering its midrange frequency clear treble and loudness it deserves 4 starsRemote Control Minimalism is great But minimalism with less functionality is not so great Addition ofMuteTV Settings and Video input selection buttons would ve made the remote more functionalApp support UpdateWhen the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime Now the TV deserves 5 stars for app supportPros and Cons Pros1 Powerful processor for 4K media playback2 App installation via USB3 Built in Chromecast4 Bluetooth remote5 Voice CommandCons UpdatePreviously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby optionBut in the latest update both these issues are solvedNow when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input sourceTo enable it go to Settngs Inputs  Enable Stay on the previous source optionScreen off feature is also added in the new update Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off optionThe only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast But on a latest update build PI4316 miracast is included and now its perfectTo sum upOverall considering the picture quality powerful hardware and the price the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of its average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across IndiaNew brands like iFFalcon Blaupunkt Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price But when it comes to service centres its a dead endI am very much satisfied with the purchaseIts good productGoodif you like a best tv on your budget Ill recommend you this stunning picture quality and DTS surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and Miracast is not good Build quality goodsound and bass excellentProduct is very good Sound quality is crisp Worth buying I brought it 2 years back Still working fineGood

NeededEverything thing good except the installation experienceOverall taking all aspects TV is good within the price pointTv installation servicesOne among the good TVs in the marketPicture,I am posting this after a few weeks of using the productUsage Continuous OTT only no CableDish operatorAverage daily usage 68 hoursThe TV is a great valueformoney productInstallation The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth timely and hasslefreePicture The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony LG and Samsung with these kind of specs Movies and especially hires TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times the output while in hires  wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony Samsung LG etc however with time you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better TVSound Sound output is decent You wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as suchRemote Sleek sensitive and userfriendly Its exactly like Amazons remoteOS Same as any smart Android TV Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances it looks just fineStandalone and as your first smart TV  you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hires from the beginning It is a great value for money product without a doubtHowever if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past you will have a hard time adjusting with itPicture quality is good for this price didnt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps Only negative will be audio definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher Overall worth for money u spend But the installation process is just awful Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals  just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through onlineScreen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user actionReason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screenIf you buy TV in a small town shop it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours When you want to buy a TV from Amazon you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable The problem is with the installation they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product Its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat So I ordered my TV on Monday it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns If we had the technician details we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours beforeRegarding product its good quality and very good for a average user Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging I guessThis TV gives good results within the budget should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part1 The installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose So strictly be aware of this point2 The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time3 Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller tooFinal verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you ThankyouTeamAlso to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing NO need to other subvendor to getting installation and demo Also dependency on thirdparty involvement should be lessBad experience with TV installation stuffPls look into this Picture quality good Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect Remote not upto the mark4  for picture quality 3 for both sound and remote qualityGood quality picture but it hangs on home

a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially However it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2 I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws  which I had bought  with him After about half an hour of arguments he finally drilled the other required holes And for all this he kept cussing me that I wasted his time There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as wellThis whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments This was the worst installation experience in my life so farBottomline  Please do not avail the so called free installation service from Amazon It is just a scam Instead call the acer support They will do the job much betterAfter using it for 2 months here are its pros and consPros 1 Great picture quality Its awesome2 Blacks are very good and is adjustable3 Sound with 30db is very good4 Looks great with thin besel5 Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons6 Content upscaling is very goodCons1 Remote could have been better Cant use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box2 Remote operation is bit complex3 Motion technology not great There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT but it decreases when you switch to DTHOverall its a nice buy at this price point I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound I am satisfied with the productProduct has good picture quality Good product at that price with 25w sound Applications running smoothly 3 months older  no issues yet Its running smoothlyYou get decent features for the price you pay Screen resolution might be Set back as you may find pixalation Overall its goodI am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p HD Ready TV It is truly an amazing panel I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther it will feel like a very small size The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions However since the speaker is downward firing the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a standThe remote is good voice search works well for me TV start up takes a long time in my opinion but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls Only negative aspect I faced is wrt the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones Firstly the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a  restart  which means I have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple Secondly the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inchesHowever I am still super happy with this TV I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my sideAt this price range11499it is good quality product on this marketacer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all okPicture quality really impressivewifi connectivity goodeasy to installboderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes laggingNo major issues found on this TVJust go

class Audio  picture qualityGood productsAmazingGoodGood productGood size for small leaving room of 1896 sound quality is also good for small leaving room,Hi all firstly I was very skeptical to purchase TV through online Secondary Iam a big fan of Sony and LG brands Thirdlyas I have 4 year old kid at home I was so scared to spend money beyond 15k Ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the Amazon great Indian festival started I saw one Plus and Hisense A6H were priced at under 20k including bank offers and my favourite Sony 43inch was priced at 35k But discarded Sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it So I was continuously searching for budget friendly TVs like TCL Redmi Nokia and Iffalcon but didnt like the 32 inch TV Suddenly out of the blue on Thursday that is on 20 October I saw this blowing offer on Hisense Vivid 4K TV but scared to buy but I felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for 15740  deal price 20990 ICICI Bank credit card instant discount 5250 so technically bought it for 15740 so I felt worth the risk and bought it On 22nd October TV was delivered to me and immediately I raised installation request and technician came on 23October and installed the TVThats my journey from searching to installationNow coming to initial impressions1 Picture  Id say being a VA Panel I can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind however colours are not over saturated I felt they are normal and when I looked at TV from sides I can clearly say it doesnt come near to IPS panel display But yeah for an average user like me its sufficient2 Remote Its simple major apps hotkeys are given YT Amazon prime video Hotstar which is good voice assistant is enabled Simple and user friendly experience It lacks hands free Google assistant3 Sound I personally felt if 30 Watts audio given in the TV it would have been great but only 24watts given which is crisp and clear though I increased volume upto 70 to chk but no distortions nothing its clear dialogues and Bass but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage4 UI It comes with Android 9 it doesnt matter to me as Im a very average user so runs the show for me I hope Hisense sends the OTA update5Now to the main point as u can see my pictures I see specially in Amazon prime video app on the blue screen there are some lines which I dont know whether its problem with panel or application Need to chk with Amazon customer service for the reason If any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super6 Conclusion  Frankly speaking i bought this TV only bcz I got it almost under 15000bought for 17520 including extended warranty for 22 years bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it wont pinch me  So from my perspective I felt its okay with some minor issues like sound I just need to get clarity on that prime video issue If that is sorted I will be happyHappy Diwali to teamI have bought this tv at 1899000 and at this price tag its a great purchasepicture quality is good not at per with sony or lg 4k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi VU etc VA Pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacksProsAndroid TVSoundColourConsRemoteLoved the picture qualityAverage picture quality but ok for this priceWorth for the cost Nice quality and

TVGood productIts really worth the money butBetter product in this budgetProduct reviewnice tvBest productBudget friendly TV,This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV I got it in the offer and it was totally worth itPros1 Sound is awesome  100 satisfied with the quality of sound Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV2 Size and slim  It is slim and looks stylish Very light weight and handy to install3 Easy to install and mount to wall4 Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home5 It gets integrated with mobile apps remote WiFi networks very quickly and easily6 The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic7 It supports all the smart features like Netflix Prime and YouTube It is easily installable and signin to start using quickly8 It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing themCons1 Picture quality is 776p Its average and not very clear But it is worth the price range Ill not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified2 Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up againRest all is very good and loved this product I feel it was worth ordering If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and dont have extensive smart use then 100 go for thisIf you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but its very good for daily family shows and TV channelsOne last thing I want to express and Im ver disappointed about is thisI got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning and even today nobody turned up I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still nobody turned upThis is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon Im very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing thisWhat do you guys expect us to do Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when its been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days Even when Im having my smart TV delivered to my home I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properlyAt least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues Highly disappointed with this behavior and serviceGood productConnectivity is fasterBut performance is little bit slowerThe biggest problem I face is it dont have a aux cable so Im not able to connect my sound barthe HDMI port is useless it wont work soi connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it wont connect automatically everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually its a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now its been 4 months and its super laggy even after the update its just the sameyeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstandingthats allGood quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice Budget friendly Im happy with this After a few days the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentencethank you amazon and oneplus1 Sound is good2 Easy installation3 very Slim and less weight4 Voice recognition is goodLikeBudgetfriendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poorMany times gets disconnectedColor depth not that

highquality 4k Smart TV from SamsungReceived DefectiveGot ReplacementNice product butTv is goodBest budget tvValue for money Samsung is always goodValue for money product,Before finalizing the AUE60 55 I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality I was told AUE60  AUE70the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro are Ecommerce exclusive models not available offline I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor panel and features but was listed at 65K for the 55 version I liked the picture quality and decided Ill get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700 and save 20kWhy I went for AUE60  vs AUE70  I knew I wouldnt be needing a voice assistant and wanted to save 3k I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant I could plug in Fire TVMi TV box and get those features later on Delivery was pretty hassle free the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages Samsung technicians came in a few hours later installed and gave a demoSoundPer other reviews  sound from speakers is apparently bad but in my case I found it satisfactory I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room and the TVs speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via BluetoothPictureThe Panels great but nothing worth raving about Gray uniformity isnt greatie gray tones wont be perfectly uniform across the whole panel therell be darker zones towards the edgescorners based on backlight placement Blacks arent perfectly black  and theyre brighter than youd expect from a VA panel but this isnt noticeable at all when the room is lit No backlight bleed Colors are as good as Id like them to be and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste even when brightness is turned down to 40 720p content is watchable from 8ft 1080p is goodId say better than I expected and 4K is well 4KConnectivityI have a 35 Mbs broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available without stutters The TV has Bluetooth 50 and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fineI use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330  theres no noticeable latency and volume can be controlled through the remote itselfApps  FeaturesHas all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed  Netflix Hotstar Prime Apple TV  YouTube All of them stream 4k content except for Hotstar  which only streamed 4K a few times 1080p is still very watchable and not really a deal breaker No Dolby Vision support  which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99 of budget TVs in the market cant produce the contrast youd expect out of DV content anyways so why care You get HDR and HDR content is definitely better looking than nonHDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy I planned to use the TV without cable but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV Bloomberg 9XM etc these stream in 1080p so a great bonus to haveRemoteVery basic RF remote unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs The remotes looks pretty sleek and stylish but thats about it Biggest gripe  typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind youll need to use the Dpad to navigate on an onscreen keyboard You can control the TV using Samsungs SmartThings App but guess what  you cant even use your phones keyboard to type in when controlling through the app  this is something that can be added through an update but its not there yetAttached pictures are all of 4K content Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review but you can still get an idea of the TVs designlooks Panel colors and contrast etcId say Im really happy  and given the chance wouldnt change my decision Its a Samsung TV so end of the day if it produces a decent picture and lasts a couple of years more than I expect I can overlook all other cons Id highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TVPlaced order on

TV,The delivery people were not careful with the unpacking Amazon needs to train their delivery staff on unpacking different types of things since they have come up with a policy where they need to open the package and verify any defects 2 stars to them as they are not careful with the unpacking I could see that they were holding the TV panel while getting the TV out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they werent Also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the ScreenHowerver very satisfied with the Sony Installation The engineer has good hands on and very experienced with the installationTV picture quality is good WiFi connection is little slow but it works mostly fine if router is nearby Delivery was good and fast The Sony installation service is very poor near Bengaluru Guy came late next day to scheduled day that too after calling many times He came and went like a bullet doesnt tell most of the things about TV like need to update system and allBut overall TV works fine We have 65 inch BraviaSong TV contacted after this review and resolved all below issue Thank u sony TVPicture  and sound quality is very good  its to good but in software so many bugs  wifi auto connectivity issue need to connect your same  wifi again and again  sound setting after conecting sound bar need If we selected Speaker audio system then need to use 2 remotes to do sound adjustment  in My Mi TV I am using only TV remote to adjust sound and aame connectivity  same soundbar  Unable to connect soundbar via bluetooth IN Mi TV same sound bar connected easlyRemote size is so big so many falatu keys in remote like 1 ro 9 no keys fast forward keys etc and in down side blank space And aftrr software update I seen little picture quality low as compare before software updateThe tv is great at this purchase price Sony tvs are generally very adaptive Colour and picture qualty is really good Sound is nice as well Would however advise to use external speakers with a tv of such sizeIf you dont wish to purchase a sound bar go for this model The picture quality is beautiful works with apple play its a win win I got the 43 for my bedroom on a great offer And yeah its a Sony A wonderful purchase absolutely worth itBest TV in its segment Outstanding built quality Sony TV may seem little bulky compared to some other fancy TVs but I have seen over the years that they never compromise on qualityI was little skeptical about picture clarity since it is big 65 TV but found it better than expected Sound quality is also very good for a LED TV Non HD channels are little less clear not bad though still it is good but its obvious seeing screen sizeHas complained on TV getting struck Their dealer called while i was driving Requested to call visit for TV reset laterTheir service manager came into conference call listened over  He advised dealer to treat the service call as closed without issue being resolved and dealer service centre till date not resolved issue  Our TV is still getting hung sometimes and we are managing by restarting tv every timeI have recently bought the 43inch model The picture  sound quality is good It does not come with an antiglare coating Do not install the TV in front of the

this read to find out Good oneGoodBest productStopped working in just 18days and worst after sale servicePerfectPrice seems to be highSolid one better and best one,Seller Cloudtail India Private LimitedPrice 2200 Price can drop as low as 1700Delivery One day Prime BangalorePackage Big carton box with air pack No damageRecommended YesReturnable YESRoom Heaters which one do you needBefore my review I will let you know which one should you buy An oil heater is best that you can buy but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than 3 months and well below 10 deg For normal winter uses I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat Please avoid conduction based ones They can consume less power cheap but they are very slow plus burns oxygen Also note whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat settingProduct ReviewThis product from USHA is a convection type room heater and I have listed the below features and information Twin Blade fan Thermostat builtin Like AC will turn onoff as per temp changes 1000W2000W operation 2000W means faster heating Fan only mode for normal table fan type Cant adjust speed ONOFF Power LED when it operates Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm 15A Power plug and 1m cord length Retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches 1 year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat No Swing option very directional You must position it correctly and securely The Thermostat option is good to have and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat as this will help reduce your EB bills as well as give comfortable weather inside The thermostat is not very accurate like in Air conditioners but works The user manual gives clear information about using itHow to set up Power on select 1000w2000w The switch is not easy to operate Set to thermostat switch to MAX Anticlockwise Let the heater run till you feel comfortable Warm inside Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning Note if you have mistakenly set it wrongly turnoff and turnon Once again follow the same step aboveI use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size In Bangalore it is about 2021 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks and it took about 2030 minutes to bring it 2627 deg with 1000w in almost closed room Please note if your place has a room temperature Not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature In such cases only use 2000 W setting It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help But you must keep your window slightly open never use it on a closed room5A or 15AI see this as a main problem as in many of our houses we only have 15A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable This unit can only be plugged into 15A socket The reason is when you operate a 230v unit with 5A socket you can only draw a maximum of 1150 Watts 230v x 5A from that socket However since this unit operates also at 2000W it requires 15A as that could only provide up to 3000W 230v x 15A like ACs etc However you can safely use this unit from a normal 5A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT 1000W ALWAYS Just buy a 5A to 15A converter socket and use this Do not worry it will work just fine but never use 2000W though If you house has MCB Tripper then its much safeTips Always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit First try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater Using after a long storage  Keep a window slightly open for fresh air Air can feel dry after sometime can cause nose irritation and dryness Room must be ventilated adding water tray can helpDrawbacks1 Fan noise sometimes unbearable in a calm room2 Average Build quality and finishingFinal wordsI recommend this product a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen but makes dry air which can easily be overcome The prices could drop around 1700 sometimes so please check price before buying Thanks for reading this if you have any doubts comment belowOn first Day  I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues I am happy on this product GoodhttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesI61GxDSyEyLSY88jpgHiI purchased this Usha 812T heater which got delivered to me on 29th Dec 21 We use it moderately for just 34 hrs in dayIt was working fine for 18 days Howeveron 19th day ie on 16Jan22 night after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khadkhadkhad sound and all its coil were red hot Since we were awake I just switched off the power from main switch It could have resulted into burning or fire if I would have delayed for few more secondsWhen I picked up the heater in hand it looked some part was loosened insideThen on the next day on 17th Jan 22 I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs However no one came in 48 hrs So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on 19th After that technician visited me Upon checking he found that out of 2 fans one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heatedI was relaxed that its not a big problem and would be fixed quickly But to my surprise the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed is not able to hold the screw tightly There was a problem with the coupler What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymoreAdding to my surprise the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available But he didnt came back When I called next day he said part is not available and has informed the company but cant say when it will be availableSo I called Usha customer care again and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asapSince then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each otherUsha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced I asked them how many days it may take as I cant keep on waiting for a month they just said they cant say when it would be availableSince it is too cold nowadays and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heaterIf they will replace it after a month winter would have already passed by thenThis is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha and it was not expected from Usha If they dont have the basic parts available with the service center what is the use of sending technician empty handedFrom now on I will never recommend Usha to

placing at one spot on office table etc and not to be moved It is very light so easily tumbles down wire cord is very short Heating is good It is not strong and sturdy but made of plastic outerbody

roomsmall cable lengthConclusionIf you are looking for a gud luking compact heater you can buy itIf you are expecting high skip itI like the product design  qualityIm using in my room It takes 15 to20 min to reduce the room temperature I will recommend this productThe only positive about this device is its price Otherwise all it has is negativeThe heater is very light weight but thats a negative coz its too light to trust it to work safely A device working at such high temperature require some weight to have stability so that weay feel confident that it wont topple The manufacture has given a safe switch at the bottom of the device but the device remains at high temp for sometime even after being offThe material body material feels very cheap and doesnt give confidence that it would last long though the PTC heating element may last longThere is nothing to prevent entry of dust and fiber into the heater that may lead to a fire in the long run if fibres accumuulate insideAlso without any dust filter the heating plates will get blocked very very soonThe switch on the backside to switch off and on also appears to be of the cheapest qualityThere is not temperature control in this heaterso once you start it it will run continuously so cant be used as overnight heater in your bedroomSo I would suggest it would be better to go for slightly costly heaters which have temp control and better qualityAs abious amazon delivery service is awesome received this product in 2 daysBuild  Built qiality is amazing dint expect this Metal frame and smooth plastic finish light weight to carry and portableThe best part I liked about it it never took time to heat just switch it on and it started blowing heat and it easily heats the room withing minutes But bare oin mind it takes 220V powerAll I can say is its the best product in this price You will not regret buying itThe Heater is effective easy to use  and very compact Work is good I like it very muchAv very low quality heater

expectedGoodPerfect Juicer  Very User Friendly in usageUser friendly and convenient to use for fresh juiceExcellent Little Juicer Fast and Easy to Clean Produces Very Good Quality JuicePremium juicerGood howeverMost effective and convinient juicer i Ever had,First of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this Philips HR1832 i made carrotapple Orange promoganateetc All i did and had fantastic juice Fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash thanks for this instant juice blenderGood dealI find this Juicer amazing endtoend it takes me around 1015mins to extract the juice clean  pack it back That easy it is to UseThe product is very good and user friendly Exactly as demonstrated in videoI used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice I wanted and I couldnt afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so I was excited to be able to start using this new one First off this is a nice compact design It really doesnt take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surfaceThe juicer is simple to take apart and put together instructions are not really needed though there are some basic pictures provided on the boxThe juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small I need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldnt need it to be much bigger to get them in So far my juicing attempts have all been successful  apples raspberries grapes cucumbers carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice I also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesnt work with  it seemed to work fine for me I can see how a banana or avocado might not work but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment The pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and I found I could easily squeeze liquid out but its in no way dripping and I would say a decent job had been done I know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldnt want in the pulp That way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with itJuicers produce different quality juices There are really 2 key areas to judge a juicer on its juice quality1 Some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item You can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted2 Some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice  2 signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients A faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth which is why the masticating style juicer slower chewing action creates better quality juiceIn terms of these 2 key areas this Philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice The slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers  To get more descriptive  I like to run the pulp of the Philips through the juicer 1 time to get extra juice out of it Running it a 2nd time and I get hardly any juice One extra run of the pulp is sufficientThe specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under 1 minute I think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off All the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater This has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff That said I have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly It certainly does not take much elbow grease and I found it very easy to clean off  unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used itI think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user Yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits The anti drip spout is not quite antidrip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as I have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place For the current price I would say it is well worth itHigh quality premium juicer with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max 80 to 90 juice out of fruits and veggies The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are availableI have been using this for a month nowIt is easy to use and clean and assembleBut at times I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grindingI feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice cause if i cut like a sliceflat one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulpTry to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 12 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and  it takes 1520 minutes to cut grind and cleanvery easy to use and very easy to assembleThanksPerfect home juicer  easy to clean assemble and comparable i loves it,Ausente,Ausente

month it was like love at first sip easy to use easy to clean easy to flex a blessing for any Indian adult Still new to french press coffee so I used South Indian filter coffee for the past few weeks and could instantly feel the difference between a cup of freshly pressed coffee and one of instant coffee although I have been advised to try grinding my own beans for optimum enjoyment I seep my grounds for around 34 minutes after heating the press for around a minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heatresistant the glass is I would however still advise taking precautions The markings inside also provide a great measurement of how many cups I would end up making Not only have i used it for making coffee but also to froth milk and to make tea Attaching photos of a coffee i made using this french press with a layer of frothed milk Ngl one of the favorite purchases my family made am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyoneTime saving coffeefilterBeen using

had the right information and was very usefulProduct Very compact We used several coffee makers in the market but all required electricity to run We wanted to have a non electric one which we can

price range in 2022Expected better BatteryOverall a very balanced productPoor Battery lifeGoodTemper glasses not istalle properlyIts 8 gb not working like 12gbApart from battery and sound quality everything else is good,Verdict  A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 and even for early 2023There are 2 reviews in this section Review 1 is 30 days after purchase Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022Before OOS 13 update 5G only for Jio was enabled via another update 5G is still not available in my region Hence 5G related parameters are not covered in this reviewReview 2 After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update Android 13Update received on 1 Dec 2023Note After the beta update no new issues popped upie there wereNo Heating related issuesNo fast battery drainNo change in the Charging timeNo annoying bugsNo change in camera performanceBeta update is mostly like a Stable updateOOS 13 Android 13 update reviewDelighters No new apps added Absolutely NOT System storage consumption remains the same 132 GB Animations are more fluidic More customization UI features added Scout widgets in home screen Enlarged folder  lot more Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor Ability to play videos in the background  screen OFF as well even for YouTube  Really a welcoming  longing feature which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF Standby battery life has improved substantiallyDisappointers Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before No improvement in Sound levels Still initial 40 is too silent No Dolby Atomos which was mentioned for OOS 13 Perhaps to wait for Stable update Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier Response time is tad increased Haptics have become tighter than earlier but still not strongerReview 1Verdict  A Good Buy in this price range in 2022Note This review is after a months usage Received 2 updates during the course of time Recent update was of 098 GB System consumes 132 GB space 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage N77 band is missing for 5G The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile No noticeable difference observed  In Nongaming aspect Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parametersThings that are delighting Exceptional signal reception especially 4G carrier aggregation Very fast download speeds Insane Fast charging 0 to 100 in 40 mins 30 to 100  in 20 mins excluding trickle charge No heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic Even more than 75 hrs for Videos YT and general tasks and calls even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver Oxygen OS  Color OSRealme OS  Bloatware The skin is really good  nothing to complain like other brands UI Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps Even some 2nd party apps are uninstallable No major bothering bugs noticed till date Yes the Alert slider is included unlike some premium OnePlus modelsThings that are annoying Dual ambient light sensor 1 in rear and other in front is not well calibrated The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required Volume level is useless until 40 level can be audible only in Pindrop silence ambience Audible enough only post 40 level Stereo speakers output are 70 bottom and 30  earpiece But full volume doesnt distort  is loud enough Haptics are tight but not strong even in higher levels Effective only post 40 and best only  90 level Hotspot drains battery quickly even a warning notification pops up Also Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm Though the inhand feel is good the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel The inbuild DAC no 35 mm hole and only TypeC port is not great The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output Perhaps Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio outputOverall its a good mobile phone The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long Not much i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 1820 hours on normal use not many themes available Samsung is better in that sense there are many wallpapers and themes available Display is clear and camera is also good Overall okayI got this mobile 12Gb 25Gb Ram variantat 31k after 3k discount on icici credit cardFor this price its a must buyI am using this product since last 2 weeksThe camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very wellThe only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better as a working professional it doesnt makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a dayIf you have no issues with the battery section then just go for itBattery drains like any thing Rest all goodI have to recharge twice a day dont buy if you want a good battery backupEven though phone is fast charge I am disappointed with battery lifeI bought 12gb and 256 and its working very smoothly for normal regular use you can go for itThere is problem with temper glass part  front

GALAXY M32 PRIME EDITION Pros  ConsGreat Phone but slow performanceGood oneGood phoneJittersMany issues in Samsung M series,Camera  Great No words for its outstanding performance at price of  10500Rs It can even beat smartphones upto 15000 Rs in camera departmentBattery  for 45min  5 charging gets discharged used for quora twitter pininterestFor 18 min  5 dischargedused for upto 500mb gaming appsSo decent batteryRemember display being amoled full hd with high PPI consumes more batteryGenerally battery stays one and a half day if used throughout the day without gamingDisplay  very colourful being amoled But only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display But that was only once I hope it doesnt occur againEdit  It happened because  I removed some permissions from system apps It never happened againTip  Try to keep brightness low prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting  screen burns in far future in amoled display of all samsung mobilesHeating  I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time But its not muchWant to know how much heat I feel Well it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low batteryPerformance  No issue as others are making it out to be You can play many games its just not smooth in heavy games In daily usage it doesnt lagI have used SD 660 before this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662I didnt play heavy games on this phone but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660 So I think those games will work here without lag as wellTip  Just because  some people got defective piece doesnt mean you will too And if you do see any manufacturing defect then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploadedNow like my

good Battery life is good Display is also very good Phone has no heating issue although I have not played any games on the phonePhone is good for normal use  display is very goodBut I  faced  some

think can be done via software update8 No heating issue9 LightweightCons1 If you use without case it doesnt feel like premium phone2 I dont like the sound quality although is has dual speaker You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad3 Selfie camera needs improvement4 Zoom is very bad on rear camera5 No IP certification6 No expendable storage7 Paid theme store8 Should have some dot notch animations like samsung  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs 35000 you can go for itTerrific purchase at the price of 33k Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also Metallic sides could be a better option Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there Camera quality is good not awesome Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand Love to see metallic frames in coming phones Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment Although its Oxygen os it is not well optimised From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model dont go for this model because of the brand One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update Another bad thing its primary camera design One of the three camera is so big that its embracing to say its price is 39kI would like to get directly to the pros and consPros1 BATTERY  The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges Its just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore2  CAMERA The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures No complains3 LOOKS  The phone looks really beautiful I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium lookingCONS1 The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of Having said that the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent Its otherwise quite smooth2 The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed I was used to it on my 6T3Volume  Not too happy with the phone speakers They somehow are not up to the markTo sum it up Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking good performing phone It packs too much for a 43k phone  good battery fastest charging in the segment premium looks good performanceUsing the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre its common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10proSo we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as wellOverall device working good so far I experienced average camera resultssuperb charging but not so extended battery life touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phoneOver all camera  is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is its processer dimencity 8100max its a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also its runs very smoothly and its my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE Im the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plusIts speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pQ4gJMwEL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Forest-Green-Storage-SuperVOOC/dp/B09WRMNJ9G/ref=sr_1_79?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-79

SinhaSujayZ,R36UIGIQWYOKTRISUCL5YV9EZN,"4,1",2,22318,4,THE PERFECT PHONE  FOR MY REQUIREMENTSGalaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability,I would not consider buying an iphone simply because my friend owns two of them  or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations which may differ from mine I am an oldfashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres megapixels and megabytes  but I think of a cellphone as a utility item not a status symbol Applying a technocratic approach I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirementsMy foremost requirement  which is entirely nonnegotiable  is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts basic net connectivity a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage Besides I would like to use a new handset for at least two yearsApart from exigencies I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet videoconferencing or sending emails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activitiesI am equally clear about what I do not need I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies reading books listening to music or creating fancy social media posts Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera At the risk of sounding flippant I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf  primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golfHaving used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years I vastly prefer the former My last phone which gave me over 30 months of good service was a Samsung M30 Since that model is obsolete now I focused on its upgraded cousins M32 M33 and M52 The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33 I concluded that the latter offers better value for money Generally it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small With these considerations I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage Just twenty years ago I was using a desktop with 2GB memoryAs a confirmation for my choice I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 8GB RAM 128GB Storage which my son had recommended The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus productAs for body colour my first choice was Emerald Brown but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phoneDespite a strong family resemblance with my old one M30 the new phone M33 offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone but these differences are acceptable to me Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates which reduces the worries on these fronts Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks it is heavy its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings so long as the M33 meets my requirementsI was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers  because old chargers like old handsets add to ewaste However it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 wattsTo cut a long story short I ordered a 25watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time After using the new handset for a couple of weeks I find that my phone is at 6070 charge at the end of the day and it takes 3040 minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10watt charger except that it would have taken 6090 minutes for full chargingI conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone  but for my requirements A word of advice if you are planning to buy a new phone it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to useWith 5G connectivity a 120Hz display and solid performance the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsungs bestvalue smartphone yet under 20K segmentProsAlmost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 41 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love none of the flagship grade features are skipped here apart from dex mode and spen features Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading of apps makes using

the fancy Android 12 features like the ability tochange the color paletteof icons and menus based on the wallpaper anddim the screen for easier reading in the dark are also includedVoice focus for calls is excellent feature phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areasI had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate signal stays strong even in rural areas thats a positive point with good accuracy4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlesslyWifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performs more than satisfactorily with low latency responseBluetooth 51 connectivity is strong and has good range no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 metersAudio quality via 35 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro much more defined and well roundedFor media consumption widewine L1 support is present Good AV experience on ott platforms I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at 1080p4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is availableMany cool camera features  boasts AR fun mode single Take Object Eraser and Video TNR Temporal Noise Reduction which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors Samsungs way of boosted colour processing some may like it some may notExcellent battery life got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage It takes around 15 hours to go from 0100 and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45 provided you have 25 watt Samsungs chargerDespite summer time phone has managed to stay relatively cool 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 30 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors making this device more value for money in long runConsUltrawide camera is on softer side  lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details  Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4kAmoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPreinstalled bloatwares like Moj dailyhunt sharechat byjus are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device but we can expect exynos 1280 to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design  Chunky in size carries some heft Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer which adds up to the value cost

is not that great in low light Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsungs new F23Thermal management is very poor Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high Same is the case when camera app is openedsimple games on flipkart gamezone are played There are reports on youtube of narzo50s camera shutting down on hot daysAbove scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazySpeaker and earpiece do not have crispiness upper treble instead sound like white noise Earpiece volume is low So is the speaker volume when on call On the other hand speaker volume is decent while playing back videosFlashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones I dont really know if company did cost cutting here or its a software bugNo fm radio and secondary micMinor features I missed if shifting from miui to realmeui  eg the gallery app is not as good as miui one requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folderMediocre ram management with realmeui 2 android 11To be fair I could not find any major bug in realmeui 20 so far The lcd display is fantastic and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point as opposed to yellowish 55006500k super amoled There was no green or purple tint Touch response was excellent Screen protector case fast charger usb c cable were present The phone feels much slimmer than my bulky F22 due to its thin body 10gm less weight and sleek case Camera app has full fledged manual mode something absent from Samsungs F22Disclaimer Above impression has been made after using 4 smartphones over last 8 years Asus Zenfone 5 Redmi 4 Redmi 7A Samsung F22Strongly consider other current alternatives too like Redmi note 11 Poco m4 pro Poco m4 pro 5g Redmi note 10t 5g  Samsung F22 Samsung F23 Moto G42 before buying Narzo 50More info Do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone Check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking I agree Turn off content recommendation by going to the Settings  Additional Settings  Get Recommendations and switch the green toggle off To remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way follow excellent guide by youtuber tech office mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands I was able to uninstall hot appsgames this wayUPDATEDetailed camera comparison between Samsung F22 and Narzo 50Samsungs HDR algo seems more sophisticated narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much there is also some oversharpeningBoth cameras choose cool auto white balance which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in golden hours However narzos colors become more hue accurate after choosing 60006500k white point in expert mode whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance Narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in expert mode but samsung fully turns it off in pro mode resulting unusable photosHowever when using night mode narzos photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night  Gcam 85 for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows much worse than realmes night mode On the other hand thereas no gcam and no camera2api support for F22 At night you can take long exposure shots upto 81632secs through expert mode by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo something you cant do in F22 This however requires tripod support and whenever done properly the results are very goodYou have manual film mode in narzo whereas you cant even manually set white balance in F22s video mode as samsungs lower end galaxys dont have pro video modeThis mobile is suitable for every oneIts goodBut camara is averagehttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesI719puSga96LSY88jpgGood qualityVery good phone Iam very happy with this while usingthank you AmaonI had purchased this phone in 10k and this phone is actually

that offers virtually everything I want,I ordered this phone based on specs it was providing later I saw flood of negative reviews coming up on Amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned if it was true1 Calls getting disconnected  I had call with my brother last night and we talked for 50 min and call did not disconnect in the middle2 Heating issue  While in day to day use never faced heating issue but It gets a little hot while charging I can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable Every phone with fast charging heats a little3 Camera Quality  It has a decent 64 mp Samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes You can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good Attached pic of cake which I clicked indoor only bright light source was candle It performed well I can sayTo people who complaint about camera   I just cannot expect picture clarity of Apple or Samsung high end devices i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid4 AnTuTu Benchmark Score  While company claim of 740000 while I tested i got a score of 700000  I again cannot complaint here because I dont know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing 700000 is pretty decent score I can say5 Phone lag  In two days of testing it has not lagged at all With multiple background apps running6 Battery Drain  Revisit few of the settings on your device like animation transition effect etc to get most out of your battery If your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most Again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company While I started to write this review my cell phone was at 100 Now its almost 25 min typing till now its now showing 99 i have set my screen at full brightness i fell its decent Also tested charging speed 0 to 50 in 1203 min7 Build quality  Its sturdy and decent plastic is used I can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint Card Discount  Exchange Benefit etc  Still I would take out 1 star here8 Black colour issue  Did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour Its AMOLED screen Black is highlight of AMOLED In case you were using IPS  FHD panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing I have Samsung M51 as secondary device and i see black similar on both9 BGMI  I played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag10 Two year warranty  They calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only 1 year I have personally wrote to Iqoo team and Amazon team seeking an answer with screenshots waiting for answerBTW majority of phone manufacturers provide 1 year warranty only even iPhone Here I would say fight for you justice and seek answer from Iqoo or Amazon Team11 Video call lag  Did not face any did multiple video calls yesterday with different people did not get any complaint from them about my video lag For all of them my video popped up instantaneousOverall I would say I had a great buy and can recommend this device to others  for all the folks bombarding negative reviews I would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied In case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justiceOverall i give this device a 4 star as of now since I am yet to test this device long term like 3 months or 4 monthsPlease excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any Entire review was typed on my phone Iqoo Neo 6I have been using a budget phone realme 3 since 2019 dynamic black 3GB64GB It served me well but it was time for an upgrade I was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything I wanted within my budget Did I get one Lets dig into itTHE GOOD Price After discounts I got a phone with practically all the features I wanted IQOO is basically from Vivo an internationally recognized brand Hopefully I dont have to worry about software updates for at least 3 years IQOO is already doing good as I have received 3 security updates so far for the Android 12 that came out of the box I will keep an eye on the security updates and OS upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for VivoIQOO for my next phone Dual 5G SIM support which is futuristic With 4G the call quality has been superb so far E4 AMOLED 120 Hz 1300 nits peak 1080x2400 pixels display with 60000001 contrast ratio 360 Hz touch sampling rate and HDR10 Netflix HDR supported A huge upgrade from my previous phone The photos OTT movies look too good Easier to read contents like messages emails or documents 64 MP main cam with OIS OIS was a musthave feature for me since I could be taking a lot of lowlight photos 4700 mAh battery with 80W FlashCharge Technology 50 in 12 min 100 in 32 min Works as claimed The battery life has been satisfactory SD 870 CPU Not one of the flagship processors today but highly capable and fantastic at this price Inclusion of 12 GB RAM has made this phone a butterysmooth one for running apps Android is quite a RAM dependent OS unlike iOS Up to 4 GB of phone storage can be used for extended RAM Currently I have 100 apps installed mostly productivity apps but no gaming apps The cascade cooling system seems to be working 256 GB ROM with UFS 31 Since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microSDXC slot and this phone is no exception I did not want the 128 GB variant A fast large internal ROM is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps files slower The indisplay fingerprint reader works well The stereo speakers are reasonably good Infrared port IR blaster I have not tried using it as a remote but a must try USBC port with USBC to USBA data cable that connects to the phone charger Some of us prefer a USBC to USBC data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices but I can see why IQOO decided to provide a USBC to USBA Most laptops still come with USBA ports even my recent hp 250 G8 laptop from the company I work for does have a USBC port without power delivery and two USBA ports My powerbanks dont have USBC ports either Screenshots lock screen virtual buttons Must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttonsTHE BAD Google backup A FAIL Since I did not have a USBC to USBC cable I had to choose the WiFi data transfer option from my old phone to this one Although I selected all the files Google failed to transfer many files especially the PDFs Dear Google this is unacceptable Spam handling My realme 3 lets me block any SMS I want but this one does not In my opinion every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an SMS as needed I have stopped using a 3rd party app like Truecaller which has become a truly rogue app No 35 mm jack a plus when you dont have a bluetooth earphone or dont prefer one but IQOO thankfully included a USBC to 35 mm adapter in the box The absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing but I do not mind as I barely drop my phone and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector and a transparent back cover Really appreciated The plastic body does not bother me moreover the dark nova color feels cool YMMV In my realme 3 and not in my realme C2 which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific OS versions if I try turning off the daily wakeup alarm it gives me options like Turn off on the next day for which the alarm is active Do not repeat any more or Cancel This is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day say an upcoming leave or holiday without turning it off for the following days Unfortunately this artificial intelligence is not available in my IQOO Neo 6 5GAlways buy a recently released model if you are going for an Android phone This will make sure that you get software support for long enough time Moreover avoid buying the variant with lowest RAMROM And fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the timeI have used this phone for  2 months and will update this review as I keep using it Till date I am quite satisfied with IQOO Neo 6 5G I also liked the Funtouch OS and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DLLa8HNWL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/iQOO-128GB-Storage-Snapdragon%C2%AE-FlashCharge/dp/B07WDKLDRX/ref=sr_1_63?qid=1672895762&s=electronics&sr=1-63

budget segmentBest value for money But afraid of future MIUI updatesDont purchase it as camera phone Dependable  its been a yearBudget mobileGood for basic usePhone is nice  but software is not,I was looking for a phone below 10K I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones My requirement was a phone that has good network reception good wifi reception a balanced software good battery life good screen that dont strain eyes a good hardware 35 mm headphone jack and a charger i dont need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data I dont watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD 2K 4K videos over mobile network For downloading documents social networks banking apps 4G is more than enoughIn my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM Realme Narzo 50 was 9999 during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11 But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749  6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away So this was the only option I knew then availableRedmi note 11 has AMOLED Display I am not bothered with 60Hz 90Hz120Hz I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you dont need that Display size is 643 inch it could have been better if it were 67 inch I prefer big display phone Redmi note 12 has that big display A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth The screen has a punch hole camera which looks goodThis phone duel speakers One is more powerful at bottom and another on top But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good What more do you expect from such tiny speakersThe phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor still I get good signal and never disconnected Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phoneThe phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point The battery gives long backup With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features like phone sms email FB WA etc But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag The experience is butter smooth However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I dont have to clear RAM manually However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared SD 680 doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage The cable is USB A to C and feels goodThis phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailableThis phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 22 storage The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life This has 2 Sim  SD card slot Which is a great Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregationThe phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones And I have no problem with plastic I dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap I am happy with plastic back The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month This is inherent chemistry of TPU and no one can prevent this chemical degradation How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlightThe fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly The touch screen is excellent tooHowever I dont like some of the preinstalled apps Some can be uninstalled a few cant especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store I dont like them However I like the pre installed security app There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good Does not show pictures like 8MP camera I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the userSo I give Redmi 11 a score of 9510 This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749 during Great Indian festival I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K k videos or shoot such things This is not or those who are crazy for 5G Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment50 days usage1 Good battery LIFE Bqest for dayday use 33W charger also good2 Best display but shouldve 120hz instead of 903 Sturdy inhand feel4 Stereo speaker is loud and crisp6535 split5 Camera above average But good concerning the price6 Buggy UIminor as expected But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 1257 4G chipset SD 680 which is fine 4G always available8 Some minor issue with WiFi reception Dont know may be they will fix it through OTA THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE  THERE CASUAL GAMER  BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWSMOVIES NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMINGNOT FOR PUBG COD LOVERSThe first look of this starbust design is eye catchyno word to express its designin hand feel and and its all physical dimension the second this which impress me its battery backupeven you playing game hardly for a long timeit gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W is also a good deal at this price The third impressive factor is its dual speakerI have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it Media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display very colour charming display literally the display quality is unbeatable The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point Fingerprint button is also very responsive All other things and features are good to the price pointOnly one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower gradeeven my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this had better camera than this So plz I request you to all  dont buy this for camerajust dont The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to meI dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phoneIf you are non camera user then you will surely go for itPros design inhand feel battery and charging amoled displaydual speakerCons cameraQuite a smooth daily driver phone The overall experience has been satisfactory cameras good durability also seems to be good Ive dropped it quite a few times  the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up 120hz feels great Charging speed is good too nothing mindblowing though Battery life is decent Lasts quite a bit but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time its a little less for me But I dont have any problem with battery life for nowIt does what the description saysCamera quality not upto the mark compared to other redmi mobiles Even A3 model clicks better picsFinger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint readVolume is good for both call and streamingFast charging but charger gets heated soonBattery back up is good unless you dont do heavy gaming and all day video sreamingDual app and dual space option is missingLight weight and good video resolutionOverall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography  gamingI bought this for my dad and its working good for him if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone userPhone is good but i facing weird bugs due to software issues After that i manually installed latest global software then working fineWhen i was using indian firmware after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec but after manual installation its working

 Top notch display gorgeous display heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to 8 gen 1 Tremendous battery life in heavy usage Super cool device Silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance good sound quality The form factor is really good I mean the screen is flat so it feels like a widenot actually wide but feels like phone also it is tall thats why it really feels good at hand I have an iPad but all the work now can be done by phone so I am happyDidnt like it  As I had op5t i loved oxygen os but now it feels like realme UI Camera is worst for this price Main sensor is good other two are useless Company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range I had op5t and previously op3tboth camera were good Op10t camera is exactly same as nord 2tConclusion  if you looking for speed performance battery life longevity best of display premium feel then go for itIf you are looking for OP experience like an alert slider or a good camera then please dont choose this Either u can wait for the next OP or go for other devices if you dont bother about UI experienceie oxygen then go for iqoo9tits far better in specgo to gsmarena compare op10r and op10t exactly same specification except processor and charging speedthis much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec I am OnePlus user since their 1st phone I have used OnePlus 1  OnePlus Nord  Nord CE Nord 5T and now 10T I have been using 10T as my primary phone since last 1 month  Everytime OnePlus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because OnePlus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them  When I saw 10T first time  somewhere in my subconscious mind I had taken my decision to buy this beast But before I reviewed so may phones from One Nord 2 to  iPhone 14My ratings Design and build 910Camera quality 710Battery backup and charging time  9510Performance 910Undoubtedly design and build is unmatched So sturdy and beautiful Camera quality might be discussion point They should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad Noone can beat its battery charging time and backup time Within 20 min 0 to 100  highly impressive It will survive around 1 day for average user Performance is good  installed and ran multiple apps at a time never faced any hung issue or app carsh issueAs I said  even if wow factor is missing this time I would say good phone with nice overall performance  design and features If you get it in sale around 40k its a good deal  Go for it  nothing to regret Purchased it some days ago Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well Im just gonna list as pros and cons Pros   I mean snapdragon 8 Gen 1 you can expect amazing performance why not top tier since its the best processor android could offer Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but its holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff Build Quality is actually good Especially the back the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone expect for the frame ofc its made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later Software Im not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo I feel its fast and a good ui of course some old features not available now since Ive used a OnePlus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os just hope its not completely turned to color os Charging is just insanity on this one switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and Ive witnessed it several times its just impressive but some issues and Ill talk about it in cons Networking and connecting is fast and good Havent faced any major issues in my networking experiences calling is a good experience connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast good overallCons  about the processor like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit although I dont care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider Like really at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit not really a big fan of alert slider so I didnt mind that part the camera setup is so so so average and stupid aside from the main lens the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment this is literally the same setup from Nord 2T but just a better software optimisation front camera is alright too nothing that great Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup usually in my usage I have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day it drains a bit more than I expected it to also theres no option available to disable 150W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery only except for the night optimisation mode which is kind of good in my opinionPhone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and its products then go for it Although Iqoo 9T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance but this device does the job tooSo  basically I am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days I am giving it 4 star because of Alert slider missing Lets me clear it by points1 Battery is awesome It will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds It lasts more than 25 hours to me2 Camera quality is nice Specially night mode is awesome Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture3 No lagging  no hang It runs smoothly and very fast4 Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone5 Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable6 While watching any OTT  streaming quality is awesome You can fully enjoy it

phoneAn all Rounder in the  30k segmentAll good battery life could be betterA good Phone with few disadvantagesValue for Money product,Posting This After 8 Days of Continous UsageI came from Oneplus 5t that too because last to last week I had an accident and my 5t has dead on the spotAfter watching a lot of reviews on Youtube and Amazon I thought I should give it a chanceFirst Impression As you all know OP 5t has small display so its hard for first 34 days to useTyping because of big display A little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last 5t Solid built but it if its metal build then it will be more beautiful Space fusion color is looking killer Flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved Display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps ie chrome brave linkdin etc youll notice a color change from Black to Greyish color that gives a cheap feel and I dont know if its a software or hardware issueActual Review While gaming Call of dutymobile has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notificationcalls even after mute notification ONN everything is coming on screen and its very frustrating and annoying Battlefield mobile ground Asphalt 9 Clash of Clans Battle Royale are working flowless Some apps like Flipkart and Airtel gives some error screen zoom automatically while opening might be because of android 12 or something else Now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when I dont want that I dont want to set them everyday before using my phone ie I am using Bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background runWhile listing to music I want paranomic 360 sound but it reset to default automatically Gesture are not working fine this can be fixed with future updates I admit that funtouch OS has some more customization then Oxygen OS but it is missing some basic customization feature like I cannot change accent color shape size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because Oneplus oxygen OS is in my eyes but I am not overcome from oxygen OS Oxygen Os is lub Funtouch OS is very uncomfortable for me for the first 45 days but now Im getting it a little Less feature in gaming mode in comparison to Iqoo 7Camera Average as of now takes good picture in nightevening time and selfie camera is awsome OIS works good as per the budget and gives value for money Day time picture are good but something it changes the saturationcolor by itself automatically No heat observed while gamingdoing heavy task minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is 40c outside so this is not a big deal for me Screen recorder and mic works awsome Crisp clear display except the issue I told above 67 SOT in one charge 0100 4244 minutes charging time 0100 No bugs lags observed till date 120Hz refresh rate made it monster Some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use Adb commande to remove permanently A few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen virus scan comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow I stopped that Speaker volume is sufficient enoug loud in a roomConclusionIn 31k its worth for money with Snapdragon 888 processor and intelligent chipOnly thing that I dont like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experinceHas some bugs as of now ie In gaming mode in a few apps camera Display that might fixed with future updatesOverall worth for money And Yes you can pick it over Oneplus 9RT like I said youll probably feel bad for a week with its Funtoch Os but youll be okay with it after sometimeJust because of oxygen os spending 810k is not a great idea I thinkCamera quality is good  Video stability is awesome processing and other functions are nice   UI is not that good and battery life is not upto the markPros Super fast app experience due to Snapdragon 888 Super fast charging good display but not comparable with Super Amoled of Samsung other phone Good large display size No heating in general use Only seen when using camera video call but it cools down fast Accessories given with the phone like Fast charger USB c to 35 female adater thin screen guard and translucent back cover Ok cameraCons Display is not super amoled or vivid like Samsung A or S Series phone Battery drains fast Avg front camera Earth current can be felt when touching back camera while chargingI was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD 888 has its own share of heating issues and all but for 28k this is one of the best phones in the segmentI had Pixel 6A and Nothing phone 1 as other options Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects the performance the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredibleAlso Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so its a plus pointThe only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to 60Hz It starts to act as it lowers to 3040 fps or something And the battery life is average Its 1 charge in the evening for sure But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enoughI use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style Recommended to allGood display good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass smooth experience camera good but front video could be given 60 fps good haptic every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better Overall satisfied with the productThey are ok i can rate 255Mobile is worth its moneyIdont use fingerprint and camera are very good battery life

another to replace the phoneHonest opinionWorth the money but not as good as promisedGood budget model phonevalue for moneyGalaxy m53Good buy for 22kA little overpriced but gets the work done,Below is the experience so far1 Received a defective product Battery was getting drained out in few hours wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble  including Google maps Location was not getting captured2 Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open tried on 7th night as well but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile  Amazon app was in this phone Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile3 Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement4 Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely  couldnt identify the issue5 Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6 First visit to center they did a software update 3 week old phone now  not sure what update would be pending and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone7 Faced issues the very same evening lived with it for one more day and went back next morning8 Second visit they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced9 I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesnt allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery which was defective11 They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they dont have the authority for that10 Called customer care number again and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the sellerSo back to step 3 Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end  If I manage to reach thereUpdate 11 All customer care said they cant replace the phone So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced Again whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again12 I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist battery was draining out by the minute I showed it to them They told me its a new battery and will take some time to stabilize They also asked me to buy a super fast charger while i bought from them to not take chances They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm Used for 2 days Same situation No improvement13 Went back to them again They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now14 Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true15 By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests15 They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed16 Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience17 I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund They refused with all their might and said phone is working now During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days I officially registered a complaint But still no luck of returning the phoneUpdate on Nov 30th18 I was traveling and outside the country On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70 charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980s Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times No luck Still grid lines My flight bookings hotel bookings and everything one can think of was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip19 Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center Nov 30th Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center They mentioned patch issue Software update dint happen  At this point I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation No 3 month old phones screen will stop responding because of software update missing They are opening the phone again to operate it after again refusing my request for money refundIts really good smartphone in its range packed with features And brand like Samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point I still give it a 37 stars as battery  could be better It also looses a point for not including a chargerPhone looks are good The charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger 25W original Also camera quality is not even like 32 MP total lied about 108 MP Samsung UI is not very friendly and easy Other brands have better and smoother UIPhone is very sleek bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is Good budget model phoneyou can not deny brand sumsung is a brand overall good product for long useGood worckCharger should have been part of it But product looks goodPricewise a little overpricedSome of the cons are a little rigid fingerprint sensor after 2 months of use i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone battery life not up to the mark struggles to go the entire day even with regular use no 35 mm jack and a buggy BTPros a very good camera excellent screen superb sound qualityIf you somehow get this for below 18k then go for it or else there are better options

SuhailGVR,R3R5DS04EXELTJR3JBXYOBYRX0A8,"4,2",3,27790,4,WORTH BUY  THE BESTGood for the price,Its been 15 days since i using the device extensivelyI bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs 41999  including 6k instant discount couponFirst let me be clear  I bought  S20 FE 5G with Snapdragon 865  not  S20 FE with Exynos  and i am a user who uses phone most of the time This review may be long but its worth to read it if youre buying this productLet me divide between the Pros and ConsFirst i would like like to start with Pros of the Device Pros 1 Display Samsung has been already popular for its AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here  They might have got some defective Piece I have no issues with my display  Its been long time i saw a great display like this  with 120Hz it is Super SmoothAlso  it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions  PS  No tint issues The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didnt faced any issues with it 2 Stereo Speakers As an extensive multimedia user  this is one of the most favorable feature for meBelieve me  you cant find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment  its almost like flagship devices Both the speakers are adequately loud3 Battery As a person whos shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone  i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usageBut I didnt even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120HzAt 120Hz  I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT  Screen on Time The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutesI didnt checked battery life at 60Hz because i didnt use it at 60Hz even a single day  The battery life is Excellent4 Rear Cameras I am not a very good photographer or something  i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionallyI was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very wellAdded Some Camera Samples above  Pic 1  Ultrawide  Pic 2  Telephoto  Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading Both the three Cameras  Primary  Ultrawide  Telephoto  performs very wellIf youre a camera guy you should definitely check this out5 Performance  RAM Management Im not a gamer  I use my device for daily usage of social media  ott platforms  Calls  messages etc but i use it extremelyI didnt faced any kind of heating issues with the device until nowAlso Ram management of the Device is excellent  I am a person who uses 45 appsbackground at single time and i didnt have any issues of closing down the apps 6 ONE UI I was a stock Android guy  but One UI actually surprised me  it is very well optimised and very userfriendly for single hand usageinitial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but Im now got used to itPS  I didnt found any kind of ads on my device as i didnt sign up or used any samsung Apps7 Build Quality Even though its back is made up of plastic  the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device8 Future Proof   The device has 9 5G Bands  IP68 Rating  Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracketIP68  Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices  Its good to see samsung brings it at lower priceThis is the best future proof device as of nowSo these are the Major pros i noticed as of now Now lets move to the ConsCons 1 NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX   As an extensive multimedia user  i found it very frustrating even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix  Samsungs Flagship Killer doesnt have HDR supportIT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE 2 No 256GB Variant   This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim  i found it little difficultBut if youre a single sim user  luckily it have hybrid solution so you can use a Sim card  expandable memory card 3 Gorilla Glass 3   Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range But S20 FE 5G has just GG3  Which also Im not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere But at the end of the day  GLASS IS GLASS  IT WILL BROKE4 No headphone Jack   It is not any kind of unusual thing most of the phones above 30K segment doesnt have headphone jackSo we have to buy 35mm to Type C adapter  type c earphones or bluetooth solutions Note  Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support5 No 25W charger   It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage but it may be a con for you   Although the device supports 25W charging  Only 15W charger is provided inside the box  They should have given 25W inside the boxI didnt have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speedFor the reference of Charging speed Both 15W  25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50 within 30 minutes where as 30 with 15W chargerFull charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes6 Front Camera   I am not a selfie guy  but if youre a person whos looking for a selfie device just dont buy it  its not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but its not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeCONCLUSION If youre a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life  great rear cameras  great performance  better software support  better build quality and use it for more than 3 years  the cons mentioned above doesnt bother youJust buy it  I am sure you wont be disappointedIts been about 15 days since I got this phone  I got it for 29990 on prime day sale For the price its goodPros 1 Camera  Coming from Poco X2 the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price It gives you good colours contrast focus and everything that you want It has OIS which is very apparent while recording At 4k60 the stability is worse But set it to  1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure Attached samples2 Display  Absolutely best Samsung displays are the best 120hz FHD Flows smoothly  Colors and calibration is top notch Brightness is good but I felt its a little insufficient under direct sunlight Its visible but could be better3 OneUI  The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software OneUI40 is the absolute best android skin right now It has way too many customisations in it and lets you personalise your phone to a very high degree Like theres a feature to read out the name of the person whos calling if your wearing headphones It took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs Also Knoxx security is a special mention Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage And many more such good features While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin it still feels very very smooth and fast to use Unlike MIUI or other skins it doesnt stutter much and bugs are lessThere are many other small pros like good stereo speakers Nice premium build quality Good data and wifi speeds Other such features that you wont notice but definitely make a difference in your experienceCons1  Software  I know I said its a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates  This phone was launched in 2021 March in India and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates  But theres a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android 14 It will receive A13 for sure Theres a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada Basically the phones life maybe 25 to 3 years if they give a14  But 15 to 2 if not I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while I was few say its not Its hard to say whos correct  So assume its not getting a14 if you are going for it2 Battery  The battery on this phone is 4500mah and its good enough for a days use But thats because I use it lightly Not much online streaming No gaming light social media and other usual stuff If you use it even a tad bit more heavily you will run out within a day If youre going outside for the better part of a daylike a day trip to somewhere nearbyits better keep a power bank handy In terms of Screen on time numbers I once got 7 hours of sot on light usage 1 hr YouTube and 15 hr streaming I was at home and used wifi all the timeI got 3 hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home On a mixed use day  you can get 45 to 55 hours of sotFinal verdict  The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models But if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years  better avoid it In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales  the price might further drop to 25k even I am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordinglyAs always amazing delivery by

achieved and the size of space coveredExcellent in every aspectVery goodLove the control from the appPurifier is good  but received a second hand itemWorks WellGood product Just works fine,Used it to keep the air inside as clean as possible This model does provide clean air over a reasonable sized space if the windows and doors are kept closedGreat product with a capability to reduce dust by approximately 34 eg if atmosphere pm25 is 300ppm  it will be reduced to upto 75ppm inside room  only if minimum ventilation is provided to take care the CO2 we generateIn my case  I have found in my area that the ambient has CO2 at 410 ppm If we open one window door to only by 5mm clearnce  the CO2 is being maintained from 500 to 600 ppm  with 2 adults inside the room  based on wind velocity and direction This adjustment 5mm clearance was achieved measuring with calibrated stand alone  CO2 cum PM 10 25  10 measurement meterOne more example with above ventilation arrangement the machine is in auto and ambient air pm25 at 198ppm room also at 198 ppm  the  fan speed reached  medium sound audible it took some time to reach  85ppm  and then it took  1min from 85 ppm to  68 ppm  now fan speed changed to low speed in Auto sound is inaudible this ppm  starts increasing gradually to 85ppm  in 15 minutes now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm 25 is 198ppmSimilarly the fan speed so its sound can be very high if ambient pollution is very highIt needs external cleaning of its HEPA filter every month based on pollution The sensor may need cleaning every 3 months for accurate readings if sensor mal functions  it is to be cleaned first and check  before taking to any service centerIt has a simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast 3 times the specified life if we clean the HEPA filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularlyIt does not have ozone producing UV rays or ion generators which if not properly designed  specified to customes not worry  may pollute the air with ozoneIt has particulate count PM 25 meter which is very accurate  in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room The readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter  CO2 PM10 PM25 and PM10We have to keep it on Auto to facilitate to change flow speed based on pollution level itstemperature and humidity meters  are also usefulUpdate 240422 still under warranty  It developed some abnormal sound just audible  when we go near to it like kitch kitch kitch at lowest speed Doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared when it is made upside downBottom cover opened  side covers opened  the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in  slightly loose condition as anticipated The abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut with 13mm tubular spanner already available with me  holding the fan  nut is a  self locking type and assembled back   But opening of side covers is a tricky and risky job some locks may be broken use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges  they may open in jerky motion  I have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting modification  so that I can open the panels easily in future However another Mi Air purifier 2S is working almost continuously without any problem from last 3 yearsUpdate 020722 High abnormal sound observed This time I want send it to service center  but while lifting some material flied off from grill So when I run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants  their wings and one baby lizard Now again it is working normalActualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter in practicality we just plug and use it Yes air quality is improving But it does not reduce any Allergic issuesReally liked the product i like how it shows the current AQI has a auto mode night mode that is super helpful with a babyThe air purifier is 45  is quiet filters well and quickly Will wait and watch for long term reliability plus the replacement filters are expensiveBut the seller shipped an item in an open box turned out to be a used product Filter says 90 remaining meaning it had been used to a good extent earlier Not sure why second hand items are sold as newWORKS WELL SINCE 5 MONTHS MORE COMMENTS WILL BE UPDATED SOONERI like because the performance is good and effective very easy to installIt works well but pollution level indicator is not reliable and keeps changing number very quickly in vide range so in night you cant use night mode,Ausente,Ausente

moneyNothing earth shaking about this productIt is goodGreat productThe product is working nicely and worth buying productWriting after 15 years pros cons solution and trics do read my reviews and voteWorks but no use,Here is a try at a review of this product after using it for an year nowUse Case I am a NCR resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst I have it installed in the bedroom about 300 sq ft so well within the advertised max room space While using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution additionBuild Quality The purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing It has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet The arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front This helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required The top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular LED screen The 4 buttons are  Power Night Mode Fan Speed and Child LockSetup The air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately Thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use The setup is pretty straightforward The main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space The installation order of the filter is as followsFirst  HEPA Filter The same has indication on top to correct installation You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerSecond  Active Carbon Filter The same has indication on top to correct installation You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerThird  Pre Filter This one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust  impurities so that it does not clog the other main filtersThus the filtering order is Pre Filter  Carbon Filter  HEPA filterWorking The air purifier can be set to different modes One of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor The pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular LED screen by means of circular rings of different colors  Blue Min Violet Pink Red Max Red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automaticallyIf you are not a fan of the automatic mode you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speedmodes They areFan Speed 1  Indicated by 1 on the screenFan Speed 2  Indicated by 2 on the screenFan Speed 3  Indicated by 3 on the ScreenAutomatic Mode  Indicated by A on the ScreenAllergen Mode  This can be only added on top of Automatic Mode It essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels This is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rateTurbo Mode  Indicated by T on the Screen This puts the fan in the maximum speed possibleThats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier Additionally the filter has an automaticforced night mode The purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode The same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier What this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noiseSummary So as to summarize my review and add my view here the filter works pretty well for the use case i have On regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from Red levels to Blue Switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels On drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control If not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levelsThe air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product Much that is missing in similar priced competitorsI am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise I believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible By reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse when i dont want to use turbo mode just yetDurability of the filters has been decent I have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the HEPA or the Carbon Filter On yes that reminds me the Air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen It even does that for the prefilter which does not have to be replaced but just cleanedwashed That i have received 34 times this past yearOverall i still strongly recommend this product Good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launchedGood productThe product does not stand out notably but it probably does the work it is supposed to It is too late now to return this product and try another makeOver all good productbEasy to installWell designed product Yet to experience filter replacement and consequently the recurring costThe product is working nicely and worth buying productWriting after almost 15 years all pros n cons Everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 68 months it become totally black few advice1 Dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked2 If you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners3 Seal your doors most dirt  mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them4 Run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was5 You can clean pre filter only dont clean carbon and hepa filter6 Being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 45 times keep it under sun light for 45 hours7 Sometimes u get error of FO clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8

Durable Powerbank in 1k range  ReviewThis is the second power bank from Ambrane India i am happyIts heavy but goodGood productGood power bankThe power is bulkier,I bought this powerbank to use during my vacation with family It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging The speed of charging is alright and appropriate The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the PowerBank itself without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buyBit heavy but does its job Takes tooooooo much time to charge Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank chargingI needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try as i already have Honor  MI power banks 10000mAh ones Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones iit did live up to my expectations for the 1k range INSIDE BOX Powerbank

device5 It comes with a carry pouch more below on this part6 Compact form factor  sturdy design with ABS body CONS1 It does not autostart charging when the device is connected2 Since it has a touch button instead of pushbutton it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling3 There is a lot of conversion loss  backup is slightly less for a 20000mAh power bank Cons are significant enough to reduce 1 star There is scope for improvement points 1  2 in this product in the same range So  device LED STATUS 1st2nd3rd4th LED blinking while charging power bank Status of

LED solid glow Battery fully charged AMBRANE BOX DEBATE1 When i first received this power bank it came in a small box approx 12x9x3cm Mfg Aug 2019 with everything forced in congested space The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal  no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch2 When replacement came it came in a polywrapped bigger box 22x10x4 cm Mfg Oct 2019 with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening Looked like it was applied with an open box So its presence was useless This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch CARRY POUCH As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit Neither loose nor tight Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon VERDICT At the price point its not a bad deal Its a midway path bw low quality and highquality ones You can very well go for Ambrane as it makes good quality  durable power banks Rest nothing is perfect in this world For this thing only 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1year warranty from Ambrame is available If one can extend the budget by a few hundred MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body  better quality overall I have MI Honor  Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be from low to high Ambrane  Honor  MII am putting up this review after 1 day of usage This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family Before to this i have bought their PP30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison My dad uses Redmi note 7 my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you dont need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP30 Solid and sturdy built 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries this i came to know while buying this product  200 cheaper price than MI Touch button at the top to know the power status this is something unique  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13 to 100 at 2 cell battery indicator which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro I dont know either it is pro or con both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 30 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 24 Amp but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dads Redmi note 7 which supports QC 40 either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 24 ampCons Very stuffy packaging it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box It has some adhesive tape at the top i dont know why  which when you remove it puts scratches on the top be careful while removing the same No torch light their PP30 have it only micro cable inside the boxDefinitely heavy but I knew this I will recommend

Durable Powerbank in 1k range  ReviewThis is the second power bank from Ambrane India i am happyIts heavy but goodGood productGood power bankThe power is bulkier,I bought this powerbank to use during my vacation with family It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging The speed of charging is alright and appropriate The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the PowerBank itself without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buyBit heavy but does its job Takes tooooooo much time to charge Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank chargingI needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try as i already have Honor  MI power banks 10000mAh ones Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones iit did live up to my expectations for the 1k range INSIDE BOX Powerbank

device5 It comes with a carry pouch more below on this part6 Compact form factor  sturdy design with ABS body CONS1 It does not autostart charging when the device is connected2 Since it has a touch button instead of pushbutton it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling3 There is a lot of conversion loss  backup is slightly less for a 20000mAh power bank Cons are significant enough to reduce 1 star There is scope for improvement points 1  2 in this product in the same range So  device LED STATUS 1st2nd3rd4th LED blinking while charging power bank Status of

LED solid glow Battery fully charged AMBRANE BOX DEBATE1 When i first received this power bank it came in a small box approx 12x9x3cm Mfg Aug 2019 with everything forced in congested space The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal  no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch2 When replacement came it came in a polywrapped bigger box 22x10x4 cm Mfg Oct 2019 with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening Looked like it was applied with an open box So its presence was useless This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch CARRY POUCH As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit Neither loose nor tight Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon VERDICT At the price point its not a bad deal Its a midway path bw low quality and highquality ones You can very well go for Ambrane as it makes good quality  durable power banks Rest nothing is perfect in this world For this thing only 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1year warranty from Ambrame is available If one can extend the budget by a few hundred MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body  better quality overall I have MI Honor  Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be from low to high Ambrane  Honor  MII am putting up this review after 1 day of usage This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family Before to this i have bought their PP30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison My dad uses Redmi note 7 my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you dont need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP30 Solid and sturdy built 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries this i came to know while buying this product  200 cheaper price than MI Touch button at the top to know the power status this is something unique  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13 to 100 at 2 cell battery indicator which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro I dont know either it is pro or con both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 30 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 24 Amp but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dads Redmi note 7 which supports QC 40 either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 24 ampCons Very stuffy packaging it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box It has some adhesive tape at the top i dont know why  which when you remove it puts scratches on the top be careful while removing the same No torch light their PP30 have it only micro cable inside the boxDefinitely heavy but I knew this I will recommend this as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phonesNice productPower backup is good but the USB cable provided is very bad It stopped working after few months of usageEverything is good but the battery
