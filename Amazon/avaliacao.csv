itInstant heatingJust go for itBest for instant heat waterAmazing productsInstant got water quite literally,I bought Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 45KW WhiteBlue and Im really happy I made this decisionLet me start with why I went for Instant Geyser instead of Storage GeyserStorage geysers have a tank to store water and heat itFor example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the waterAs it has to heat high volume 10 lts of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutesInstant geysers on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutesHowever the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volumedepending on tank capacity of hot waterNow who should opt for Instant Geyser and who should opt for Storage Geyser is the question  If you like to have a Shower Bath for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for Storage Geyser since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pausesInstead if we consider Instant Geyser of 3lts capacity for shower bath it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water againHence for a shower bath better to go for Storage GeysersIf you like to have a Bathtub Bath then instant geysers are good to go becauseConsider using a bathtub a bathtub generally is of capacity 350ltsIf you even use a Storage Geyser of high capacity as much as 25lts still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes eachBecause at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 510mins for the next 25lts to heatSo to fill the entire bath tub you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water  350ltsSo the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins on an average  98minsIn this scenario of Bathtub bath its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small youll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heathotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for Bucket Bath Both Storage geysers of 15lts or above and Instant geysers of 3lts or above are good to goJust choose based on  Price  Time taken to heat  instant takes less time   Energy consumption  instant comsumes less Now coming to Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 45KW why I bought this Havells is a great brandI wanted to have it for Bathtub Bath45KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this productI have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds  I have used a timer to note that The installation was totally free however remember you will be charged if there is any Plumbing Work do be doneNo need to buy any extra accesories like pipes everything is provided in the box you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rsAs soon as the product was delivered by amazon I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done thanks a lot Havells  This might differ for you based on your location I live in hyderabadI really like havells customer serviceThe geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tankIt has Auto Cutoff feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off  however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats It shows color indication Blue when its heating and Orange when it has done heating  Have a look at the pictures I have attachedNoteGo for the 45kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of waterMake sure it is 45kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the Mustard colored geyser is not 45kw but 3kw  better go for white and blue color to be sure Very nice productGood product45KW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water Good productGreat product at great priceValue for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2minHavella water heaterWater heats up in 4560 secs depending on the weatherThis review is after using this water heater continuously for 1012 days in December in Kolkata with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 1415 degree Celsius during afternoon early evening hours On the coldest day so far it took around 1min 1015seconds to heat up completelyIf you dont have chronic pain or arthritis or this is not going to be used for very old people whereby really hot water is required for bathing I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 910 degrees because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower not using a bucket and its manageableObviously cant be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser but this heats quite quickly so can be used in the shower even with the low capacityFor that same reason it can be used for multiple people because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters youll have fully hot water only of lesser quantity so if you dont live someplace cold or dont need very hot water but mildly hot water this can be used for multiple people as wellInstallation support was also goodNo cons only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 45kW range then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesnt have their own home and might need to move around because its compact and provides instant hot water,Ausente,Ausente

par with those brewed in CCDvalue for moneyNiceDoesnt justify the DescriptionGood for the priceUnnecessary BuyDelivery without Warranty Card,This machine can easily brew coffee for a family of 46 members at a time Some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe The answer is simple NO Reason is that this isnt a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewerNow my experience with this machine was good And a bad thing was that I did not get the steam pipe sleeve Except that everything was well packed When you buy this machine make sure to rinse the internal passage throw the first water from the machine thoroughly wash the caraffe puck filter and measurement spoon Remember to NEVER USE dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe puck or anything such It may ruin the coffee aromaMethod efficient as per my opinion1 Fill the water in tank No need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector Dont run it dry It may damage the heating element or pump2 Switch ON the machine After that pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter level it and press it to compress I use 12 ratio 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output3 Before changing over to drip mode open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built Placing carafe under the puck slowly move the selector till Europa and quickly back it to steam icon This will let the coffee bloom inside After 57 seconds slowly move the selector upto Espresso The decoction should be not too slow or not too runny4 Wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode5  Take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk Place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus Slowly open the steam valve located at the side Steam it as per your need6 Mix the milk and decoction Thats itRemember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside Open the steam valve and let all the pressure get releasedCoffee used Bombay Island Espresso grind Medium Roast Use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind Dont use Aeropress V60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired tasteI personally like this machine For the price its good and build quality is Moderate Please watch some YouTube videos if you are new to coffee machines Its very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge You may also watch James Hoffmann He is World Barista Champion and shares tips about coffeeIm a fan of espresso Every time I go to a coffee joint I tend to order a doppio A double shot espresso But those prices are way too high if I wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday So Ive decided to buy this machine One thing to say the quality and durability depends on the user If you take care the machine would take care of your cup of joeSo how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing1 Always rinse the drip tray2 Use 10 dish washing liquid with 90 water to clean the carafe3 Do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds Run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds This is crucial because dents can affect quality4 Before and after your brewing activities make sure that you clean the internals To do this fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water  Assemble an empty permafilter  Switch on and set the strength to max In about a minute you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe Check its color If its yellow then rinse and repeat If it is white dry everything and switch it off Then either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day5 Always let the steam out When you froth milk immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothWARNING NEVER EVER USE HARDTAP WATER IT CAUSES SERIOUS LIMESCALING ISSUES WHICH CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE TASTE QUALITY OF YOUR COFFEE IT MAY ALSO CAUSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES ALWAYS USE SOFTCAN WATERTHE WATER MUST NOT TASTE SALTY OR SWEET  TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY PLEASE DO NOT POST MISLEADING REVIEWS STATING THAT MY MACHINE BROKETHE STEAM KNOB IS THE WORST PART OF THIS MACHINE THE MACHINE WAS USED JUST FOR 14 DAYS THEN THE STEAM KNOB DECIDED TO LOOSEN UP AND FALL OFF I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT THERE THE PROBLEM IS IM JUST 17 AND I CANT DRIVE AND THE SERVICE CENTER IS FAR AWAY SO I REMOVED THE RUBBER CASKET AND FIXED THE KNOB DIRECTLY IT COMES OFF BUT I THINK ILL USE IT ONLY TO EASE THE PRESSURE BECAUSE I ALWAYS DRINK IT BLACK BUT THIS ISSUE MAKES ME REDUCE A STARTips for using the machine1 Use fine grounded coffee I use Narasus PB or Royal Elite Bold Currently  Im using Phalada Pure  Sure Organic Coffee Powder For the best results you must grind the coffee on your own If you cant make sure the coffee is fresh Mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster both for the machine and your stomach respectively You can also go for Lavazza But it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the Mariana Trench2 Only use good quality bottledcan water3 Maintain a good cleaning discipline4 In case youve used hardtap water immediately do a descaling Refer your instruction manual5 Always tamp your ground in the filter You must apply about 30 pounds of force This is about 13 kg of force Hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it Make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisAs you can see this is a real espresso maker It produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee For me it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot This is good for a steam driven machine Note that this is a steam driven machine You can never get the finish of coffee joints because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps Although the tastes would be similar provided you use the correct beansPlease look at the pics  to see the finish The cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old The brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder Ive just bought Can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness This applies even to taste The white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth The brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best leaving a crisp and nutty taste Also after I did some research I came to know that an espresso must have three layers A bitter crema a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom You must mix these before drinking to have the best shot If you see the glass picture Ive attached  you can clearly see those layersOVERALL THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MACHINE FOR A BEGINNER IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO AND IT IS ECONOMICAL TOO AS I SAID IF YOU TREAT THE MACHINE WELL THE MACHINE WOULD TREAT YOUR CUP OF JOE WELLBeing a coffee enthusiast the product fits in my requirementEasy to use Time taken is reasonable Adjustment of intensity works wellFrothing tool is very good though i prefer black coffee frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guestsNice productThe coffee strength nob is a mythBut itne paise me itna is goodVery happy with the machine works fine and easy to operate unfortunately it wasnt packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken  everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the boxIt makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult Also was shocked to know this is not covered under Amazons return policy My bad I didnt check and now I am stuck with this Life is no better after you buy thisCoffee maker delivered without Warranty Card  Instruction manual,Ausente,Ausente

cleanliness of air achieved and the size of space coveredExcellent in every aspectVery goodLove the control from the appPurifier is good  but received a second hand itemWorks WellGood product Just works fine,Used it to keep the air inside as clean as possible This model does provide clean air over a reasonable sized space if the windows and doors are kept closedGreat product with a capability to reduce dust by approximately 34 eg if atmosphere pm25 is 300ppm  it will be reduced to upto 75ppm inside room  only if minimum ventilation is provided to take care the CO2 we generateIn my case  I have found in my area that the ambient has CO2 at 410 ppm If we open one window door to only by 5mm clearnce  the CO2 is being maintained from 500 to 600 ppm  with 2 adults inside the room  based on wind velocity and direction This adjustment 5mm clearance was achieved measuring with calibrated stand alone  CO2 cum PM 10 25  10 measurement meterOne more example with above ventilation arrangement the machine is in auto and ambient air pm25 at 198ppm room also at 198 ppm  the  fan speed reached  medium sound audible it took some time to reach  85ppm  and then it took  1min from 85 ppm to  68 ppm  now fan speed changed to low speed in Auto sound is inaudible this ppm  starts increasing gradually to 85ppm  in 15 minutes now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm 25 is 198ppmSimilarly the fan speed so its sound can be very high if ambient pollution is very highIt needs external cleaning of its HEPA filter every month based on pollution The sensor may need cleaning every 3 months for accurate readings if sensor mal functions  it is to be cleaned first and check  before taking to any service centerIt has a simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast 3 times the specified life if we clean the HEPA filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularlyIt does not have ozone producing UV rays or ion generators which if not properly designed  specified to customes not worry  may pollute the air with ozoneIt has particulate count PM 25 meter which is very accurate  in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room The readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter  CO2 PM10 PM25 and PM10We have to keep it on Auto to facilitate to change flow speed based on pollution level itstemperature and humidity meters  are also usefulUpdate 240422 still under warranty  It developed some abnormal sound just audible  when we go near to it like kitch kitch kitch at lowest speed Doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared when it is made upside downBottom cover opened  side covers opened  the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in  slightly loose condition as anticipated The abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut with 13mm tubular spanner already available with me  holding the fan  nut is a  self locking type and assembled back   But opening of side covers is a tricky and risky job some locks may be broken use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges  they may open in jerky motion  I have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting modification  so that I can open the panels easily in future However another Mi Air purifier 2S is working almost continuously without any problem from last 3 yearsUpdate 020722 High abnormal sound observed This time I want send it to service center  but while lifting some material flied off from grill So when I run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants  their wings and one baby lizard Now again it is working normalActualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter in practicality we just plug and use it Yes air quality is improving But it does not reduce any Allergic issuesReally liked the product i like how it shows the current AQI has a auto mode night mode that is super helpful with a babyThe air purifier is 45  is quiet filters well and quickly Will wait and watch for long term reliability plus the replacement filters are expensiveBut the seller shipped an item in an open box turned out to be a used product Filter says 90 remaining meaning it had been used to a good extent earlier Not sure why second hand items are sold as newWORKS WELL SINCE 5 MONTHS MORE COMMENTS WILL BE UPDATED SOONERI like because the performance is good and effective very easy to installIt works well but pollution level indicator is not reliable and keeps changing number very quickly in vide range so in night you cant use night mode,Ausente,Ausente

User Friendly in usageUser friendly and convenient to use for fresh juiceExcellent Little Juicer Fast and Easy to Clean Produces Very Good Quality JuicePremium juicerGood howeverMost effective and convinient juicer i Ever had,First of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this Philips HR1832 i made carrotapple Orange promoganateetc All i did and had fantastic juice Fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash thanks for this instant juice blenderGood dealI find this Juicer amazing endtoend it takes me around 1015mins to extract the juice clean  pack it back That easy it is to UseThe product is very good and user friendly Exactly as demonstrated in videoI used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice I wanted and I couldnt afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so I was excited to be able to start using this new one First off this is a nice compact design It really doesnt take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surfaceThe juicer is simple to take apart and put together instructions are not really needed though there are some basic pictures provided on the boxThe juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small I need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldnt need it to be much bigger to get them in So far my juicing attempts have all been successful  apples raspberries grapes cucumbers carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice I also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesnt work with  it seemed to work fine for me I can see how a banana or avocado might not work but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment The pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and I found I could easily squeeze liquid out but its in no way dripping and I would say a decent job had been done I know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldnt want in the pulp That way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with itJuicers produce different quality juices There are really 2 key areas to judge a juicer on its juice quality1 Some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item You can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted2 Some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice  2 signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients A faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth which is why the masticating style juicer slower chewing action creates better quality juiceIn terms of these 2 key areas this Philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice The slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers  To get more descriptive  I like to run the pulp of the Philips through the juicer 1 time to get extra juice out of it Running it a 2nd time and I get hardly any juice One extra run of the pulp is sufficientThe specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under 1 minute I think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off All the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater This has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff That said I have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly It certainly does not take much elbow grease and I found it very easy to clean off  unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used itI think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user Yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits The anti drip spout is not quite antidrip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as I have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place For the current price I would say it is well worth itHigh quality premium juicer with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max 80 to 90 juice out of fruits and veggies The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are availableI have been using this for a month nowIt is easy to use and clean and assembleBut at times I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grindingI feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice cause if i cut like a sliceflat one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulpTry to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 12 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and  it takes 1520 minutes to cut grind and cleanvery easy to use and very easy to assembleThanksPerfect home juicer  easy to clean assemble and comparable i loves it,Ausente,Ausente

missing may be because OnePlus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them  When I saw 10T first time  somewhere in my subconscious mind I had taken my decision to buy this beast But before I reviewed so may phones from One Nord 2 to  iPhone 14My ratings Design and build 910Camera quality 710Battery backup and charging time  9510Performance 910Undoubtedly design and build is unmatched So sturdy and beautiful Camera quality might be discussion point They should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad Noone can beat its battery charging time and backup time Within 20 min 0 to 100  highly impressive It will survive around 1 day for average user Performance is good  installed and ran multiple apps at a time never faced any hung issue or app carsh issueAs I said  even if wow factor is missing this time I would say good phone with nice overall performance  design and features If you get it in sale around 40k its a good deal  Go for it  nothing to regret Purchased it some days ago Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well Im just gonna list as pros and cons Pros   I mean snapdragon 8 Gen 1 you can expect amazing performance why not top tier since its the best processor android could offer Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but its holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff Build Quality is actually good Especially the back the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone expect for the frame ofc its made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later Software Im not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo I feel its fast and a good ui of course some old features not available now since Ive used a OnePlus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os just hope its not completely turned to color os Charging is just insanity on this one switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and Ive witnessed it several times its just impressive but some issues and Ill talk about it in cons Networking and connecting is fast and good Havent faced any major issues in my networking experiences calling is a good experience connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast good overallCons  about the processor like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit although I dont care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider Like really at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit not really a big fan of alert slider so I didnt mind that part the camera setup is so so so average and stupid aside from the main lens the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment this is literally the same setup from Nord 2T but just a better software optimisation front camera is alright too nothing that great Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup usually in my usage I have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day it drains a bit more than I expected it to also theres no option available to disable 150W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery only except for the night optimisation mode which is kind of good in my opinionPhone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and its products then go for it Although Iqoo 9T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance but this device does the job tooSo  basically I am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days I am giving it 4 star because of Alert slider missing Lets me clear it by points1 Battery is awesome It will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds It lasts more than 25 hours to me2 Camera quality is nice Specially night mode is awesome Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture3 No lagging  no hang It runs smoothly and very fast4 Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone5 Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable6 While watching any OTT  streaming quality is awesome You can fully enjoy it 7 Speaker of phone is perfect even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on

option  project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option  need to be connected on same WiFi network2 Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service  Awful1 The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially However it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2 I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws  which I had bought  with him After about half an hour of arguments he finally drilled the other required holes And for all this he kept cussing me that I wasted his time There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as wellThis whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments This was the worst installation experience in my life so farBottomline  Please do not avail the so called free installation service from Amazon It is just a scam Instead call the acer support They will do the job much betterAfter using it for 2 months here are its pros and consPros 1 Great picture quality Its awesome2 Blacks are very good and is adjustable3 Sound with 30db is very good4 Looks great with thin besel5 Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons6 Content upscaling is very goodCons1 Remote could have been better Cant use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box2 Remote operation is bit complex3 Motion technology not great There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT but it decreases when you switch to DTHOverall its a nice buy at this price point I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound I am satisfied with the productProduct has good picture quality Good product at that price with 25w sound Applications running smoothly 3 months older  no issues yet Its running smoothlyYou get decent features for the price you pay Screen resolution might be Set back as you may find pixalation Overall its goodI am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p HD Ready TV It is truly an amazing panel I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther it will feel like a very small size The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions However since the speaker is downward firing the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a standThe remote is good voice search works well for me TV start up takes a long time in my opinion but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls Only negative aspect I faced is wrt the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones Firstly the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a  restart  which means I have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple Secondly the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inchesHowever I am still super happy with this TV I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my sideAt this price range11499it is good quality product on this marketacer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all okPicture quality really impressivewifi connectivity goodeasy to installboderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes laggingNo major issues found on this TVJust go

improvements in set upGood OneVery user friendly when compare with othersBest for home useGood for home usegood printerGoodGood for occasional printing Extremely easy to use,I bought this item in August 2022 and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as Ive come to expect from Amazon Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct supportThe only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup1 Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didnt actually lead to much of a guide rather a boilerplate page I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor2 Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever  I must have removed and reinserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected No error messages showed up and I didnt know if I had recieved a faulty product or if I was doing something wrong3 Never having owned a printer and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray leading to a jam at the first print itself Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets  clearer access to the online guide mightve helped hereExcept for the these minor concerns in setup Im enjoying using this printer surprisingly since printers alongside projectors  are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry Ive used all the features so far  print  colored double sided scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality wifi or the cartridges Information on the number of color and blackandwhite sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when I run outgood scanner  printerInstallation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high I had a Xerox copier but istallation of scanner option could not completeIf you are purchasing it for your home use dont look any further It has got all the functions youll find in a 2030k worth printers All in one includes print scan copy and fax as well Colour adf duplex printing wifi You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself Only two issue that I faced firstly the print qualitywhich Ill speak to the service center and secondly is the total quantity of color prints I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90 I guess Ill have to purchase a larger cartridgeVery good printer Sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage But overall very happygud printer but printing cost is expensive in this price range features are very niceI got this printer ion 02Nov2022 After 15days of usage Im unable to print as it is showing Color  black ink is low i have print less than 50pages and in description they told that 400pages yield which is totally wrongCannon E4570This was launched as a successor for E4270 I searched everywhere but couldnt find a credible source to explain the differences between the two I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me  wifi enabled so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop clear color print decent for childs homework photo quality not required and cheap to run E4270 seem to fit all the criteria so I ordered this Even the canon authorised showroom didnt have E4570 in stock so ordered the E4570 off AmazonSummary  fullfills top two criteria Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional printDelivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon so that was great It was just the printer box with no outer packing The box was sealed with cello tape and not sealed so I suspect it had been opened at some point Thankfully all the components were there and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact so i was ok with the deliverySetup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi I never had to use the usb cable Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website link for both given in manual which guides step by step on how to setup I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devicesColor prints are a bit faded on plain paper 75gsm This might be a function of the paper and not the printer The blackwhite prints are crisp and sharp The print speed is decentThe only negative is the amount of ink consumption While the box says 180 color prints and 300 bw both my cartridges are showing at 80 after 4 color print and around 30 bw Specially for color prints the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 23 prints I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 3040 full color pages Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option but it is messy and requires practice This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarelyA special mention for the ADF and duplex printing Both the features are extremely useful Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range and comes in very handy while printing larger documentsOverall I am happy with

productStopped working in just 18days and worst after sale servicePerfectPrice seems to be highSolid one better and best one,Seller Cloudtail India Private LimitedPrice 2200 Price can drop as low as 1700Delivery One day Prime BangalorePackage Big carton box with air pack No damageRecommended YesReturnable YESRoom Heaters which one do you needBefore my review I will let you know which one should you buy An oil heater is best that you can buy but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than 3 months and well below 10 deg For normal winter uses I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat Please avoid conduction based ones They can consume less power cheap but they are very slow plus burns oxygen Also note whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat settingProduct ReviewThis product from USHA is a convection type room heater and I have listed the below features and information Twin Blade fan Thermostat builtin Like AC will turn onoff as per temp changes 1000W2000W operation 2000W means faster heating Fan only mode for normal table fan type Cant adjust speed ONOFF Power LED when it operates Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm 15A Power plug and 1m cord length Retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches 1 year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat No Swing option very directional You must position it correctly and securely The Thermostat option is good to have and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat as this will help reduce your EB bills as well as give comfortable weather inside The thermostat is not very accurate like in Air conditioners but works The user manual gives clear information about using itHow to set up Power on select 1000w2000w The switch is not easy to operate Set to thermostat switch to MAX Anticlockwise Let the heater run till you feel comfortable Warm inside Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning Note if you have mistakenly set it wrongly turnoff and turnon Once again follow the same step aboveI use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size In Bangalore it is about 2021 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks and it took about 2030 minutes to bring it 2627 deg with 1000w in almost closed room Please note if your place has a room temperature Not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature In such cases only use 2000 W setting It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help But you must keep your window slightly open never use it on a closed room5A or 15AI see this as a main problem as in many of our houses we only have 15A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable This unit can only be plugged into 15A socket The reason is when you operate a 230v unit with 5A socket you can only draw a maximum of 1150 Watts 230v x 5A from that socket However since this unit operates also at 2000W it requires 15A as that could only provide up to 3000W 230v x 15A like ACs etc However you can safely use this unit from a normal 5A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT 1000W ALWAYS Just buy a 5A to 15A converter socket and use this Do not worry it will work just fine but never use 2000W though If you house has MCB Tripper then its much safeTips Always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit First try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater Using after a long storage  Keep a window slightly open for fresh air Air can feel dry after sometime can cause nose irritation and dryness Room must be ventilated adding water tray can helpDrawbacks1 Fan noise sometimes unbearable in a calm room2 Average Build quality and finishingFinal wordsI recommend this product a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen but makes dry air which can easily be overcome The prices could drop around 1700 sometimes so please check price before buying Thanks for reading this if you have any doubts comment belowOn first Day  I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues I am happy on this product GoodhttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesI61GxDSyEyLSY88jpgHiI purchased this Usha 812T heater which got delivered to me on 29th Dec 21 We use it moderately for just 34 hrs in dayIt was working fine for 18 days Howeveron 19th day ie on 16Jan22 night after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khadkhadkhad sound and all its coil were red hot Since we were awake I just switched off the power from main switch It could have resulted into burning or fire if I would have delayed for few more secondsWhen I picked up the heater in hand it looked some part was loosened insideThen on the next day on 17th Jan 22 I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs However no one came in 48 hrs So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on 19th After that technician visited me Upon checking he found that out of 2 fans one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heatedI was relaxed that its not a big problem and would be fixed quickly But to my surprise the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed is not able to hold the screw tightly There was a problem with the coupler What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymoreAdding to my surprise the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available But he didnt came back When I called next day he said part is not available and has informed the company but cant say when it will be availableSo I called Usha customer care again and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asapSince then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each otherUsha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced I asked them how many days it may take as I cant keep on waiting for a month they just said they cant say when it would be availableSince it is too cold nowadays and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heaterIf they will replace it after a month winter would have already passed by thenThis is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha and it was not expected from Usha If they dont have the basic parts available with the service center what is the use of sending technician empty handedFrom now on I will never recommend Usha to anyone and if any Usha representative is reading this post I request to them to service my heater asapThanksGo ahead The cord is very short and required 16 amp plug point It eats up available oxygen in closed roomUsing since one year  found fit for house
