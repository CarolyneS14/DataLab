terms in the description  Slider  Sliding part of webcam cover Static Frame  Static back frame of webcam cover Screen Frame  The laptops screen frameThe product is sturdy invisible for the mutual color theme for device and product and well manufactured If the device has the same matte black theme this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the devices body As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishinglythe product has merged with it The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam coversIt is ultrathin as described by the company withacquiring about a millimeter thickness This thickness can cope with the windowslaptops as they are havingthe rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lowerup bodykeyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screenThis spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lidwill not harm the screen screen frame and laptop lowerup body But still dont put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself The sliding function is very smooth but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usageThe device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lidsNow for the Mac Laptop  users it is not a product for yourlaptop and never try this product for your Mac laptops As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers that is theres no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of thisproduct will damage crackbreak the plain glass screenInstallation is easy remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker using the scale for support or else you could stick it a little inclined After sticking rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultralight pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes And there you go for your satisfied invisible lifeImportant  Even if not in use slide it 25 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dustOverall it is a good product For me it has worked awesome Green Signal from hereThank You SUGGESTIONSTo the Manufacturer  Notice the static frame of the webcamcover and make its edges the edges close to the slider smooth rounding off or fillet so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger it can easilyslide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frameTo the Seller  Well packagingTo the Consumer  Check for the rubber spacersbuffers provided in the laptop like Windows laptops if it is then you can use the webcam cover if not like Mac laptops its not the product for you Even for Windows laptops after installing a webcam cover try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long Slide it 25 times once a week to avoid jammingDISCLAIMERThe reviews and ratings hasve been made upon personal usages  experiments  experiences  perspectives for specific products acquired  deliveredI usually dont trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try It was delivered within 3 days after placing the order I received it on 12th June First impressions were really good I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but Its been 35 months and theres not even a single crack in my screen  You will get 3 webcams covers in the package Its extremely thin So It wont cause any issues when you close the laptopHp pavilion gaming used here but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air Asus TUF Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen At the end its your choice I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak It literally falls off after a week of applying it I had to throw 2 of it as it became useless I only had the last piece remaining    Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol Then apply a strong Adhesive glue I used Fevi Kwick Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover Since its extremely thin I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue  will spill out and make a mess Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop And then youre good to goIts been 3 months after using the Super Glue technique Forget about about falling It has not even moved a bit No effect on the quality of my webcam The cover wont interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings And fully covers it when you want privacy Overall Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesionGood productI wish I had known this before ordering Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied itApple urges people not to close their MacBook MacBook Air or MacBook Pro while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook It may also affect the ambience light sensor but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costsMacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper 01mm should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop This item is 0027inches thick that is 06mm six times the recommended thicknessIf you are going to use it on your MacBook be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop You can use it without worry on iMac as its a desktop and doesnt get closed You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isnt embedded inside the glass screen If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okayFor disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options One is you trust Apple who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light According to them one cannot work without the other so even if someone hacks your camera you will know it is on because the green light will be glowingIf youre not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera use a piece of thin tape Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen but frankly if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing i dont see how there could be an issueWhy am I still giving this product 3 stars It reached in good condition is easy to install and use and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera Its not a bad product They just need to stop advertising it for

I would like to answerDecent at this priceVery niceNot for speedy writeNice pen good quality could be more smootherSmoothSuperb Fountain Pen for all types of users,First of All Delivery of Amazon It was as specified no delays Hence appreciate itPackaging Not Good The box was tempered torn and damagedProduct Ordered Black received brown Didnt replace as the Color didnt much mattered Issue is with the seller thoughPerformance The pen of good Robust feels cheap however looking at the price not to complain Writes smoothFor anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens can start with this as it does the jobEdited Have been using this pen for over 3 days now I am facing issue of nib dryness If I dont use the pen for sometime The pen doesnt write at all I have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing It writes great when it starts writing But the initial pick up is really bad I have a platinum preppy too Its a better option to go with if the budget is tight However there we have good writing but bad looksFew points I have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer Compared with two other pens Parker Vector and Luxor V51 Grip  Read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the curve at the grip which makes it awkward to hold Honestly have not felt so at all The grip is pretty medium larger than Parker Vector and comparable to the Luxor V5 It wont create any problems holding it I am an average 510 and people of same build hand and finger size wont be any problem Also on Parker Vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages Been nice to hold the Elegante and feel firm in hand it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance  2 Nib and feeder  It says Fine on the nib and it is comparable to the Luxor V5 05 and Parker Fine nib Few claim it is 07  medium kinds Its all about the pressure on puts when writing it I just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does so would say it is Fine It is way too smoooooother and fluent than Parker which felt a bit rough Parker Fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience However on Elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper It is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides The feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience The writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging This ensures that one gets to write about 6 pages ie 12 sides without a refill3  Plastic construction and feel in hand  The cap is made of brassas they say The cap has a matte finish not a glossy one The clip and top is glossy Gives a fair enough good contrast to add some looks to it when taking it out of the pocket D  The pen itself very much plastic If I try to weigh both the cap and pen separately roughly they feel of same weight it is that light weight  just a feel factor how I felt However this does not mean it is a cheap construction It has fallen from 2 floors down and did not crack anywhere so would say its good strong plastic It makes one feel pretty solid holding it The size if compared to other two is larger It rests pretty well in between my thumb and index fingerwhich parker does not Luxor does  hence never needed to put the clip on the rear Without the clip it is very much balanced Parker and Luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top  with clip Elegante and Parker feel a bit top heavy4 Ink filling  Personally always been a fan of eyedroppersgood old school days  however this comes with the standard piston filling as seen in the photo by Hari When I immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half Had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled In parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient For Luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious Some other reviews I read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper Few said it worked  few said it leaked Need to substantiate it Not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece If anyone has tried would love to hear your experience5 Writing after 3 weeks  For Luxor it works immediately Even after 6 months it worked like magic For Parker bit of dipping or couple of splashing out and it starts For Elegante it did not start immediately From school days used to have an Airmail unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted it used to work like a beauty even after 3 weeks Elegante on this aspect did not fair so well However how many of us are not going to use their Pen for 3 weeks always something to write sign or pen down   It worked fairly after a break of one week6 Colour  Personally the looks of a pen hardly matter to me Its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul We pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks For few people this matters more individual choice and nothing against it  Parker gives a good classy look Luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive Elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both Neither a college going look nor an Executive look On looks it does fair enough justice The cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart Would have loved if they would have made more colours than Maroon Black and Blue Nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what Reynolds have bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them This does enough for me7 Spare Nibs and feeder  Not sure if there are spare nibs available online I am at a location which is 100s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers lticaptd   After using this nib I would personally not place any other nib I am pretty happy about it always good habit to have spare nibs dont know when one drops it and needs to change8 Recommended for  Its a must for student At this price range where one is still studying and not earning this sounds a good buy though not the best as Luxor beats this is VFM Parker would never recommend it for students If someone wants to carry it for exams carry 2 atleast all due to the limited piston converter capacity Luxor would be best If you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives This is fair on looks and pleasure for writing      9 Value for Money  For a standard person like me or a student Luxor beats Elegante and Parker However for a fountain pen This is an excellent VFM Well this sums up my experience after using it Anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it First of all it came in a really bad condition The package was almost flattened All thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery Thank God it doesnt have any dent Secondly it is probably a used product Because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box Thirdly the brand claims that it is having a fine nib but probably according to the European standards I am a Pilot lover so I know what fine nib is This is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of Pilot Using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm You remember the experience for a long time The handwriting also becomes better Thats lacking in this pen Thankfully it doesnt squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens I had two Wingsungs Those were unbearably squirty Fourthly the grip is average Fifthly if you are a beginner you may go for it as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens You may use it as a day to day penBUT DONT STICK WITH THIS ONE ONLY EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PILOT IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET TRUST ME YOU WONT LOOK BACK TO A PEN LIKE THIS I WAS GIFTED A PILOT CROCODILE FINE NIB BY MY MOM I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORIES WITH THIS PEN SAFE SO I DONT USUALLY USE THAT THATS WHY IVE BOUGHT THIS ONE Lastly and most importantly a suggestion to the buyers to make your pen experience ergonomic please dont put the cap on the backside Open the cap keep it aside and unleash your writingvery nice pen its really amazing very smooth writingthank you seller  amazonIts not for speedy writing if you are use for signature its cutting off character Some time spread over ink And some time character cutting Cheap plastic product but at a 200 good for beginnersIve been using this pen for about 3monthsprosBuild quality for this price is amazinggold Nib looks amazingconsNib comes out easilyJust that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to Guys I have started using fountain pens again a few months back I had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like COLLEGE brand eye droppers Camlin Parker made in USA Hero China made Recently I am using Platinum Preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is Japan made This the Camlin Elegante is our very own Made in India pen It makes us proud Just superb pen Very smooth It is actually a no nonsense pen Only thingsince I had read a few negative reviews about thisI am using it with PILOT BLUE ink I dont know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what Whatever it may beThis pen with Pilot ink combination rocksjust superb experience of writing with THE FOUNTSIN PEN Thank you Camlin and Thank you Amazon,Ausente,Ausente,BAIXA,BOM,BOM,RUIM,RUIM,BAIXA

mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked But not sure what problem we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issuesNot sure seems as I bought from this Amazon or MI service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problemOnline service person instead sending Technician to home for verifying problem Told and did build version update with me to latest Software update Later he said Volume limit got increased to 100 now we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior ie Before if 1520 volume level gives big sound then now 5060 volume level the same sound Asked when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of Volume limit increase But he told OTTsome apps

terms in the description  Slider  Sliding part of webcam cover Static Frame  Static back frame of webcam cover Screen Frame  The laptops screen frameThe product is sturdy invisible for the mutual color theme for device and product and well manufactured If the device has the same matte black theme this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the devices body As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishinglythe product has merged with it The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam coversIt is ultrathin as described by the company withacquiring about a millimeter thickness This thickness can cope with the windowslaptops as they are havingthe rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lowerup bodykeyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screenThis spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lidwill not harm the screen screen frame and laptop lowerup body But still dont put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself The sliding function is very smooth but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usageThe device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lidsNow for the Mac Laptop  users it is not a product for yourlaptop and never try this product for your Mac laptops As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers that is theres no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of thisproduct will damage crackbreak the plain glass screenInstallation is easy remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker using the scale for support or else you could stick it a little inclined After sticking rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultralight pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes And there you go for your satisfied invisible lifeImportant  Even if not in use slide it 25 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dustOverall it is a good product For me it has worked awesome Green Signal from hereThank You SUGGESTIONSTo the Manufacturer  Notice the static frame of the webcamcover and make its edges the edges close to the slider smooth rounding off or fillet so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger it can easilyslide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frameTo the Seller  Well packagingTo the Consumer  Check for the rubber spacersbuffers provided in the laptop like Windows laptops if it is then you can use the webcam cover if not like Mac laptops its not the product for you Even for Windows laptops after installing a webcam cover try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long Slide it 25 times once a week to avoid jammingDISCLAIMERThe reviews and ratings hasve been made upon personal usages  experiments  experiences  perspectives for specific products acquired  deliveredI usually dont trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try It was delivered within 3 days after placing the order I received it on 12th June First impressions were really good I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but Its been 35 months and theres not even a single crack in my screen  You will get 3 webcams covers in the package Its extremely thin So It wont cause any issues when you close the laptopHp pavilion gaming used here but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air Asus TUF Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen At the end its your choice I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak It literally falls off after a week of applying it I had to throw 2 of it as it became useless I only had the last piece remaining    Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol Then apply a strong Adhesive glue I used Fevi Kwick Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover Since its extremely thin I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue  will spill out and make a mess Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop And then youre good to goIts been 3 months after using the Super Glue technique Forget about about falling It has not even moved a bit No effect on the quality of my webcam The cover wont interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings And fully covers it when you want privacy Overall Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesionGood productI wish I had known this before ordering Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied itApple urges people not to close their MacBook MacBook Air or MacBook Pro while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook It may also affect the ambience light sensor but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costsMacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper 01mm should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop This item is 0027inches thick that is 06mm six times the recommended thicknessIf you are going to use it on your MacBook be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop You can use it without worry on iMac as its a desktop and doesnt get closed You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isnt embedded inside the glass screen If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okayFor disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options One is you trust Apple who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light According to them one cannot work without the other so even if someone hacks your camera you will know it is on because the green light will be glowingIf youre not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera use a piece of thin tape Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen but frankly if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing i dont see how there could be an issueWhy am I still giving this product 3 stars It reached in good condition is easy to install and use and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera Its not a bad product They just need to stop advertising it for MacBooks,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PeQz-jDSL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/LIRAMARK-Webcam-Blocker-Computer-MacBook/dp/B08BQ947H3/ref=sr_1_317?qid=1672895842&s=electronics&sr=1-317,ALTA,BOM,BOM,RUIM,RUIM,ALTA

price range in 2022Expected better BatteryOverall a very balanced productPoor Battery lifeGoodTemper glasses not istalle properlyIts 8 gb not working like 12gbApart from battery and sound quality everything else is good,Verdict  A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 and even for early 2023There are 2 reviews in this section Review 1 is 30 days after purchase Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022Before OOS 13 update 5G only for Jio was enabled via another update 5G is still not available in my region Hence 5G related parameters are not covered in this reviewReview 2 After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update Android 13Update received on 1 Dec 2023Note After the beta update no new issues popped upie there wereNo Heating related issuesNo fast battery drainNo change in the Charging timeNo annoying bugsNo change in camera performanceBeta update is mostly like a Stable updateOOS 13 Android 13 update reviewDelighters No new apps added Absolutely NOT System storage consumption remains the same 132 GB Animations are more fluidic More customization UI features added Scout widgets in home screen Enlarged folder  lot more Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor Ability to play videos in the background  screen OFF as well even for YouTube  Really a welcoming  longing feature which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF Standby battery life has improved substantiallyDisappointers Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before No improvement in Sound levels Still initial 40 is too silent No Dolby Atomos which was mentioned for OOS 13 Perhaps to wait for Stable update Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier Response time is tad increased Haptics have become tighter than earlier but still not strongerReview 1Verdict  A Good Buy in this price range in 2022Note This review is after a months usage Received 2 updates during the course of time Recent update was of 098 GB System consumes 132 GB space 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage N77 band is missing for 5G The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile No noticeable difference observed  In Nongaming aspect Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parametersThings that are delighting Exceptional signal reception especially 4G carrier aggregation Very fast download speeds Insane Fast charging 0 to 100 in 40 mins 30 to 100  in 20 mins excluding trickle charge No heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic Even more than 75 hrs for Videos YT and general tasks and calls even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver Oxygen OS  Color OSRealme OS  Bloatware The skin is really good  nothing to complain like other brands UI Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps Even some 2nd party apps are uninstallable No major bothering bugs noticed till date Yes the Alert slider is included unlike some premium OnePlus modelsThings that are annoying Dual ambient light sensor 1 in rear and other in front is not well calibrated The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required Volume level is useless until 40 level can be audible only in Pindrop silence ambience Audible enough only post 40 level Stereo speakers output are 70 bottom and 30  earpiece But full volume doesnt distort  is loud enough Haptics are tight but not strong even in higher levels Effective only post 40 and best only  90 level Hotspot drains battery quickly even a warning notification pops up Also Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm Though the inhand feel is good the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel The inbuild DAC no 35 mm hole and only TypeC port is not great The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output Perhaps Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio outputOverall its a good mobile phone The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long Not much i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 1820 hours on normal use not many themes available Samsung is better in that sense there are many wallpapers and themes available Display is clear and camera is also good Overall okayI got this mobile 12Gb 25Gb Ram variantat 31k after 3k discount on icici credit cardFor this price its a must buyI am using this product since last 2 weeksThe camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very wellThe only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better as a working professional it doesnt makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a dayIf you have no issues with the battery section then just go for itBattery drains like any thing Rest all goodI have to recharge twice a day dont buy if you want a good battery backupEven though phone is fast charge I am disappointed with battery lifeI bought 12gb and 256 and its working very smoothly for normal regular use you can go for itThere is problem with temper glass part  front Cemera area temper glass not installingGood but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 its ordinary like 8gb Apart from battery and sound quality everything else is

GALAXY M32 PRIME EDITION Pros  ConsGreat Phone but slow performanceGood oneGood phoneJittersMany issues in Samsung M series,Camera  Great No words for its outstanding performance at price of  10500Rs It can even beat smartphones upto 15000 Rs in camera departmentBattery  for 45min  5 charging gets discharged used for quora twitter pininterestFor 18 min  5 dischargedused for upto 500mb gaming appsSo decent batteryRemember display being amoled full hd with high PPI consumes more batteryGenerally battery stays one and a half day if used throughout the day without gamingDisplay  very colourful being amoled But only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display But that was only once I hope it doesnt occur againEdit  It happened because  I removed some permissions from system apps It never happened againTip  Try to keep brightness low prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting  screen burns in far future in amoled display of all samsung mobilesHeating  I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time But its not muchWant to know how much heat I feel Well it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low batteryPerformance  No issue as others are making it out to be You can play many games its just not smooth in heavy games In daily usage it doesnt lagI have used SD 660 before this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662I didnt play heavy games on this phone but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660 So I think those games will work here without lag as wellTip  Just because  some people got defective piece doesnt mean you will too And if you do see any manufacturing defect then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploadedNow like my

product but low quality at less priceI took for meetings and it working wellGood but built quality okProblem with comfort for long hours callingHeadphoneIt does the job wellNoise cancellation is quite good in this price rangeWork with teams perfect budget headphones,Sound quality is ok noise cancellation is not Upto the mark volume is good Overall for the price its worth product The cushion on the mic comes out easily  couldnt have been fixed properlyGoodThe built design is ok for the product Everytime i wear and do the resizing my hair gets stuck in the band which is irritating Rest sound and all is goodI stopped using it after continuously using for 3 hrs for office use It can not be used for long duration calls or back to back meetings Ears starts paining after 23 hours use Speaker cover is very thin I will give this device to someone needySound quality and built quality is nice but comfort is huge issue with this device due its tight overhead band It keeps both sides on ear for getting better sound or noice cancellation But the one who is looking for noice cancellation will buy over ear bigger headphonesI use all types of headphones overear onear earbuds Earlier used Sennheiser onear headphones but it never gives painIdeally if anyone buying onear simple headphones then it is for calls or meetings where they still want to hear sound in their room Some attention to sound in your room for example keeping an eye on kids while being in meeting Basic padding or multiple layer soft covers for onear will be helpfullGuys go for iBall rocker overear or HP overear wired headphones for long duration office calls It cost less compare to this Logitech deviceHowever this is still good buy for upto 60 mins use for 1 sessioncallmeeting and then a break Only issue for people having back to back meetingsNice qualityI bought this because I had to work from home and had to take calls My only worry was the noise cancellation because I live next to a busy road And I am happy with the purchase as the noise cancellation is working great People on the other side of the call have never complained about any kind of background noise The plastic quality used is great and its not squeaky The wire is long enough The sound output is good enough but I dont intend to listen any music on these If you need something for music then this is a wrong productCon The cushion is not adequate and starts hurting the ear lobes within 5 mins I had some extra cushions so I added those over the ear pieceBuild quality is not that good but sound qualitynoise cancellation is best in the range of less than 1000After covid19 our life changes a lot Online meeting conferences webinar even online classes became new normals In this situation a good headphone with mic is necessary for doing work flawlessly and this headphone has everything which i needed1 Audio quality is good and crystal clear without any additional noise2Mic is also very good with good noise cancellation3Thanks to amazon for their service and ontime delivery Getting early delivery for the product was bit urgent for me and it was delivered in almost 6 hour after placing orderI am fully satisfied with the product highly recommend for students and working professionals who have limited budgetyou wont regret it 4 Only thing i am missing is volume control on

priceCable quality not good thoughQuality Iron for power users with effective spray  steam function  Review  Guide  TipsDoesnt remove hard wrinklesEasyto use but it leaks waterVery easy to useGood productQuick warm upNot good,Update as on 28102018The power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visiblethe insulation pvc of the cores doesnt look very durableI dont know why such standard manufacturers cant provide a decent durable cableThe iron however is performing flawlesslyStill disappointed as in coming weeks ill have to change the cable for sureReducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand nameHOW IT STARTED  THE NEED FOR AN IRONxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRecently  my previous Bajaj make dry iron which I received as a gift from somewhere started giving problems after two years of occasional use  with not so careful handling and care Initially Its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which I repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems Finally its ON indication went OFF and I decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new oneHence my search for a reputed brand make  best value for money device began Being from Electrical Engineering background  occupation I fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below1 DRY IRON VS STEAM IRON xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but viceversa was not possible Also almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purposeOn the contrary As the steam  loosens the individual fibres of the clothes the steam irons pressing action smooths out wrinklesHence it was better to be  equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself2 BRAND REPUTATION  WARRANTYxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAs an average consumer We are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better Rightfully so A brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience  research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted uponFollowing the same footprints I thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the Super brands like Philips having decades of expertise in this fieldOur product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion 3 STEAM OUTPUT  STEAM BURST  VERTICAL STEAM FEATURExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxDuring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above 8 gramsmin is okay but Some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam In such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy Users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed More holes in the sole plate add  to the effectiveness of steam  suppliedVertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam  in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing forceHowever in practical scenario and by virtue of  its design and water tank limitations  a steam iron is virtually incapable of  addressing the wrinkles like that and  hence paying more for such a feature is not advisedUse dedicated garment steamers for that purpose Our Philips GC1905 comes with a variable setting for steam  output with a continuous delivery of  up to 17 gramsmin which is quite goodAdditionally It can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles Vertical steam feature is not available though4 ELECTRICAL RELATED FEATURES WATTAGE CORDTHERMOSTAT etcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks1 Surely more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above 1500 Watts  I would suggest to only plugin to the power socketsGoing for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you  really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times2 Surely More heat developed  is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective Your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settingsGenerating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system3 Last but not the least  More power  doesnt always mean  quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material  thickness of the sole plate  Surface area of  the heating element used  inside the soleplate etcMost of  these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer OUR PRODUCT Comes with a decent 1440 Watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics Comes with a 250 Volts 10 Amp  Max rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage 3 pin Top which can  be easily plugged into our casual 6 amp sockets as well without any damage to the socketHence enhanced mobility  performance The cord length is around 18 meters which is good enough for any practical lengthsAny more than that would be cumbersome to handle The cord  is braided with an insulated  cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damageHowever in due course of use the cord often develops rigid twists  turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten outSo not so great on the cable quality terms The cable only comes with 180 degrees of swivel movement which is quite disappointing and I would  have  really wished if it was 360 degrees of cord freedom The thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular 5 settings but going with a reputed brand like Philips always assures of a good quality of thermostatAfter all the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable Lastly our product is an ISI marked product  which is quite an assurance for sure5 SOLEPLATE MATERIAL  SHAPExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplatesA variety of soleplates are available in the market today like nonstick Teflon coated aluminium plates with American  heritage coating Steel plates with alloys or Ceramic coatedEach has its pros and cons Teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time American Heritage is similar to Teflon and glides over the fabric even better Stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settingsAdds weight to the device Metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers Good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution  but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stickWhen  ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex a ceramic iron will suit your needs best as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling Aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes Our Product comes with a linished soleplate which  is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat However apart from linishing stuff I can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding Its heavy but doesnt stick to the clothes yetFor that matter I trusted  the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate Stay away from Teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off  fastRegarding the shape  I honestly wanted  it to look like American fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colorsLOLHowever those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this StillDecent Looking model6 FEATURES LIKE ANTI DRIP ANTICALC GRIPxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxTo tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose  for most of the users Presence of these features isnt a problem  though  as in areas where the water comes hard Anticalc may stir and clear the calcium build up if any in the water tankHowever If you use proper water drain it out timely  Do not fully fill the tank  allow it to heat before using steam   follow all procedures correctly you wont actually need to use these featuresRegarding Grip Many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip Our product comes with the anticalc function  and is decent to grip though I think not ergonomically still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon7 PRICE VS PERFORMANCExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxEven though I did not have any preset price tag in my mind  but still going over 2500 would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that I dont make use of that much I bought it at a price of around 1200 bucks  for  all the features and performance it delivers  I think it is worth itFINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all  I would just say that even though our product might not have the best  appealing looks or the best soleplate or  the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord  still what it has is   a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent rightperforming way which is hard to come by in an  individual modelI got this one ondemand from mother For a few days she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores I was already researching iron for one of my friends So this search did not last long DEven earlier Philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency  product quality I also had Bajaj Usha Morphy in the list But trust in Philips did not let me go for any other brandI got this Iron well

Linished Teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics Gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture4 Sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage5 Capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation 30 min or more in one fill6 Spray function is well designed it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water7 The spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric making it easier to iron out tough creases8 Wattage 1440w is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes9 Easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole10 Easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole and the sideways opening door11 Weight on the ok side not a lightweight but not even heavyweight Some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth Empty iron is lightweight onlyCONS1 Steam control knob looks loose at first but it works well in the long run2 Water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation But thats the way it will work  you cant do anything3 For regular lightweight iron users it will appear bulky at first But you get used to it in a few days4 No steam burst function in this model GC1905 but you get what you pay for Cons are temporary and dont affect functionality in the long run So a  deviceBUTTONS  KNOBSSpray Button push to spraySteam Knob Off no steam Low less steam High high steam Calc clean mode calcium deposit cleaning more belowTemperature Dial Rotate to set temperature cutoff for different fabric types Linen Cotton Woolen Silk etcUSAGE GUIDE1 Keep knob  dial in off position2 Fill the tank to the max level if planning to use steam function3 Connect to mains4 Set the temperature control knob to the required position5 Let it warm up until the indicator goes off6 Now operate steam knob to low or high steam7 Enjoy ironing or steaming without interruption till water lasts8 Use water spray function as requiredUSAGE TIPS1 Use RO filtered water if possible as its low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices2 let the iron heat properly before use Leakage has been observed if one uses the Iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam3 Gently clean soleplate and dont use any hard material or chemicals4 Emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem As calcium deposits are more in standing water5 Untangle  straighten the cord once after every use before storage As these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure6 When not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position7 Use calc clean mode once in 2 weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness If water is very hard increase the frequency or if using RO water decrease frequency8 Once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar To remove the needle rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out9 Last but most important use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocksCALC CLEANING MODEThis iron has a calc cleaning mode to descale it To do so follow the steps below1 Keep knob in the steam off position2 Fill tank to max level3 Rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off4 Take out socket from mains and move iron to sink5 Turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms6 Let all water be used up7 Steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits The principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone which leads to contraction  expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush outCLARIFICATION DAMAGE TO BODY OR PLATE  OTHER ISSUES concerns raised by other usersSeveral users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues Let me put my insights into those I had no issue with the quality of the product delivered It arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere as proper care was taken for this using air cushions Maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit Soleplate had no marks on it Yes here Philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints for the damaged sole plate on arrival Temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage Slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones as different materials are used as per requirement Say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back Leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water So its passed directly  appears as leakage Philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details Remember to order it from a reputed seller Check seller ratings reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues like the faulty product duplicate product etcDONT GET CONFUSED Theres No Steam Burst Mode Here1 Some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button  even some users have mentioned this in their reviews but it is not present in this model Models with the said function have two buttons for spray  burst instead of one here for spray only2 Also steam output at one place is 13gmin another place 17gmin Its actually 17gminFINAL VERDICT If you are looking for good quality durable steaming iron in the 15k range Philips is the name you should seek for This model of Philips has got good build quality  features which are more than enough for an average home user So at any point you can go for this model If on a lower budget 1k range you can go for Philips GC1011 1200w or Bajaj MX 3 1250w but both are low power and Philips one misses steam spray function too But still both will cover most of the usage pattern of a home user Heavy users may go for Philips EasySpeed Plus GC2040 2100w or BlackDecker BD BXIR2001IN 2000w or Morphy Richards Super Glide 2000w in 2k rangeNOTE Unlike regular lightweight irons steam irons generally dont go easy with repairs Unlike regular iron If the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced  if you are out of warranty it will cost you a lot In fact for the cost of the plate plus a few bucks you get a new iron So check your requirement for regular vs steam iron  choose wiselyI tried removing hard wrinkles of a jeans but it couldnt remove them properly They were still visible even after using the steamEasyto use but it leaks waterVery goodIts a good productIron is good and the best delivery with few hours just this iron doesnt have a stream burstrest is goodSimple cloth iron,Ausente,Ausente,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,ALTA

maintainingcleaningreplacing bagsNice little vacuum cleaner but with a couple of drawbacksSimple and EffectiveAOn the heavier side but satisfied with the productGood quality heavy noiseGreat ProductAwesome Cleaning Machine,Once you start using a bagless vacuum cleaner you will never turn back using it on a weekly basis since Nov 2021 so its a long tern review Coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags this one is truly a hasslefree cleaner at least you are away from the hassle of maintainingcleaningreplacing bags which is truly a mess and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags Further devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then leading to less suction INSIDE BOX1 Vacuum cleaner unit2 Flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob3 Turbo brush nozzle4 Multiclean nozzle5 High suction flat inlet nozzle6 Telescopic extension pipe7 User manual8 Warranty cardThe power cord is 6mtr and device comes with a mechanish to retrace it back into the machine It has normal 16 amp 2 pin top which can easily fit in 3 or 5pin sockets both 56 amp or 1516amp but better to connect it to 1516 amp ones only considering its power consumption OBSERVATIONS  PROS1 Device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber and you can empty it in the dustbinno hassles of cleaning and replacing bags2 Components are high quality such as the telescopic extension is metallic though its also a con for this attachment Even plastic components are of good quality3 Device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels You dont need to pull it by force4 Default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted Its a highly useful attachment considering its attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use5 Each attachment here is multipurpose When you open the package you feel like very few attachments are provided but when you start exploring you discover that all attachments are multipurpose details below6 Attachments are easy snap fit and remove ActiveLock in the companys terminology Once you insert the attachments it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever7 Both the turbo brush and multinozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning8 Dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it These filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging9 the Main unit has H13 filter system to filter fine dust dust mites etc and is equivalent to HEPA 13 as per the company This filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes10 Device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears Its in the bearable range OBSERVATIONS  CONS1 Telescopic extension is metallic and heavy So its a bit of trouble to use for longer durations especially when you are trying to clean ceilings2 Reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction So effectively this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end but then consumes the same amount of power If there had been a control mechanism to reduce power it would also save electricity3 Device comes with a 16amp top but its 2pin so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime4 I miss the blower system in this cleaner which is handy at times was there in my previous cleaner They could have easily implemented itFor the cons reducing 1 star but its definitely a 4star device Attachments Flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe Multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power and with one press it goes nearer to the floor Turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush there is a button to lock it Main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multiclean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes FINAL VERDICTThis bagless vacuum cleaner is a hasslefree device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost and if you are willing to stretch your budget its definitely worth it I have had no any issues so far in the past 1 year when using it regularlyThis is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning It also comes with good set of accessories I found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the Croma store Two drawbacks not a deal breaker I found and I hope Philips addresses them were1 It comes with a two pin 15 ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal 5 ampere plugs in the house I was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during 1520 minutes of cleaning each room in the house I do not see a point in having that plug2 During the use one just pulls it along but It has no handle to lift the machine I believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but I am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the clickon mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hoseAs I mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if Philips addresses the issues on this great little machineSuction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet  window curtains floors and carpetsCleaning the dust container is also very easy Only concern i have is if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor after using the machine for nearly 1 hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this would have been even better if this had blower functionality alsoGood productCord length and Suction power is satisfactoryGood quality heavy noiseThis is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and I can say that I am a happy customer I bought this back in August 22 and it is serving me well It comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places it has three modes of cleaning tiled floors carpets and sofas and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier Thank you Phillips for a good product and thank you Amazon for a smooth transactionWellbuilt topnotch quality suction power is too high,Ausente,Ausente,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,ALTA

in 35k categoryTerrific purchaseA highly priced smart phoneCant get better at this cost Review after one month of useOxygen OS is providing poor experience overall device is okayAmmazing ProductOkay,I am using OnePlus 10R 8GB 128GB more than one month It is my first ever OnePlus phone My personal review about this phone is as underPros1 Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice Cover quality is very nice2 Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness Also screen color and touch response feels premium3 Battery life is very impressive with 15 day backup with normal use4 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes5 I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smoothI think itll play heavy games smoothly So it perform well6 I am new to use Oxygen OS I feels OS premium and smooth without adds7 Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update8 No heating issue9 LightweightCons1 If you use without case it doesnt feel like premium phone2 I dont like the sound quality although is has dual speaker You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad3 Selfie camera needs improvement4 Zoom is very bad on rear camera5 No IP certification6 No expendable storage7 Paid theme store8 Should have some dot notch animations like samsung  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs 35000 you can go for itTerrific purchase at the price of 33k Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also Metallic sides could be a better option Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there Camera quality is good not awesome Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand Love to see metallic frames in coming phones Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment Although its Oxygen os it is not well optimised From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model dont go for this model because of the brand One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update Another bad thing its primary camera design One of the three camera is so big that its embracing to say its price is 39kI would like to get directly to the pros and consPros1 BATTERY  The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges Its just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore2  CAMERA The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures No complains3 LOOKS  The phone looks really beautiful I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium lookingCONS1 The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of Having said that the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent Its otherwise quite smooth2 The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed I was used to it on my 6T3Volume  Not too happy with the phone speakers They somehow are not up to the markTo sum it up Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking good performing phone It packs too much for a 43k phone  good battery fastest charging in the segment premium looks good performanceUsing the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre its common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10proSo we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as wellOverall device working good so far I experienced average camera resultssuperb charging but not so extended battery life touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phoneOver all camera  is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is its processer dimencity 8100max its a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also its runs very smoothly and its my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE Im the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plusIts speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pQ4gJMwEL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Forest-Green-Storage-SuperVOOC/dp/B09WRMNJ9G/ref=sr_1_79?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-79,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,ALTA

 Top notch display gorgeous display heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to 8 gen 1 Tremendous battery life in heavy usage Super cool device Silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance good sound quality The form factor is really good I mean the screen is flat so it feels like a widenot actually wide but feels like phone also it is tall thats why it really feels good at hand I have an iPad but all the work now can be done by phone so I am happyDidnt like it  As I had op5t i loved oxygen os but now it feels like realme UI Camera is worst for this price Main sensor is good other two are useless Company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range I had op5t and previously op3tboth camera were good Op10t camera is exactly same as nord 2tConclusion  if you looking for speed performance battery life longevity best of display premium feel then go for itIf you are looking for OP experience like an alert slider or a good camera then please dont choose this Either u can wait for the next OP or go for other devices if you dont bother about UI experienceie oxygen then go for iqoo9tits far better in specgo to gsmarena compare op10r and op10t exactly same specification except processor and charging speedthis much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec I am OnePlus user since their 1st phone I have used OnePlus 1  OnePlus Nord  Nord CE Nord 5T and now 10T I have been using 10T as my primary phone since last 1 month  Everytime OnePlus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because OnePlus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them  When I saw 10T first time  somewhere in my subconscious mind I had taken my decision to buy this beast But before I reviewed so may phones from One Nord 2 to  iPhone 14My ratings Design and build 910Camera quality 710Battery backup and charging time  9510Performance 910Undoubtedly design and build is unmatched So sturdy and beautiful Camera quality might be discussion point They should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad Noone can beat its battery charging time and backup time Within 20 min 0 to 100  highly impressive It will survive around 1 day for average user Performance is good  installed and ran multiple apps at a time never faced any hung issue or app carsh issueAs I said  even if wow factor is missing this time I would say good phone with nice overall performance  design and features If you get it in sale around 40k its a good deal  Go for it  nothing to regret Purchased it some days ago Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well Im just gonna list as pros and cons Pros   I mean snapdragon 8 Gen 1 you can expect amazing performance why not top tier since its the best processor android could offer Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but its holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff Build Quality is actually good Especially the back the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone expect for the frame ofc its made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later Software Im not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo I feel its fast and a good ui of course some old features not available now since Ive used a OnePlus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os just hope its not completely turned to color os Charging is just insanity on this one switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and Ive witnessed it several times its just impressive but some issues and Ill talk about it in cons Networking and connecting is fast and good Havent faced any major issues in my networking experiences calling is a good experience connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast good overallCons  about the processor like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit although I dont care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider Like really at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit not really a big fan of alert slider so I didnt mind that part the camera setup is so so so average and stupid aside from the main lens the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment this is literally the same setup from Nord 2T but just a better software optimisation front camera is alright too nothing that great Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup usually in my usage I have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day it drains a bit more than I expected it to also theres no option available to disable 150W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery only except for the night optimisation mode which is kind of good in my opinionPhone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and its products then go for it Although Iqoo 9T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance but this device does the job tooSo  basically I am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days I am giving it 4 star because of Alert slider missing Lets me clear it by points1 Battery is awesome It will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds It lasts more than 25 hours to me2 Camera quality is nice Specially night mode is awesome Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture3 No lagging  no hang It runs smoothly and very fast4 Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone5 Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable6 While watching any OTT  streaming quality is awesome You can fully enjoy it 7 Speaker of phone is perfect even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413c3ZnFLxL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Moonstone-Black-128GB-Storage/dp/B0B5V47VK4/ref=sr_1_300?qid=1672895835&s=electronics&sr=1-300,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,BAIXA

Cotton Linen and thick materiel fabricsReceived brokenOnly for lighter fabricThere is a learning curve it may take 2 people to do itIt looks like an imitation product  pieces dont match properly and some look very weakExcellent product and received in good conditionNot great,Takes space and not convenient if in a hurry The handheld model would be better suited and more useful for frequent useI used this product once after reading the manual The first impression after using it on 3 cotton shirts without starch and one pant is pathetic None of the shirts got wrinkle free on full steam hence you could guess what it would be in trousersLater I found it is satisfactory on silk nylon shirts T shirts etc but none will get an iron effect Wrinkle will be there in small amount and a slight wet feel when the steam cool down but it will go if fastIt is mainly useful for ladies who wear embroidered nylon silk materials stone work fabrics etc etc men who use T shirts and nylon rich trousers Otherwise dont even think of buying it In my case I use cotton whites and white trousers mainly at office as I am a lawyer Hence for me it is totally useless No females at home and hence it is another product that grab my home spaceRegarding comfort while using it I would say I am totally disappointed as the board behind it is not much of use while using g shirt because of its size which is not that long The last two button downwards will always hard to press it to board and we have to take the hanger hold high on one hand and thus another difficult part as the nylon material needs another hands to hold it firm Secondly the long full sleeves are totally difficult to do it though steam is applied the wrinkles wont go easily add we are not pressing it to board and it will always go here and there The top stand is a hanger shaped but the clips attached as useless as the board comes in between For trousers the product itself wont work good So if we use the hanger it comes with you need to put the switch off place the handle in slot take the shirt out and then only we can use the back side to steam after waiting again to steam up switch on etc otherwise steam will go on coming out of itAny way the product is more useful that those similar without a pressing boardThe next negative thing is manual says for better lasting of product and  to avoid decalcification the water After use should be drained and cleaned Hence it means you cant use it daily morning in rush while going to office That needs little time At the same time you cant press all dress in a stretch and cant fold it like we do with iron box It wont work that away So if you have long large cupboard with hangers as in mansions you can try thatIn effect buy it if you find exceptions and usages apart from what I mentioned abovePS  I am seriously thinking of OLX Received a broked packedge With broken itemI thought it would make my task of ironing easy but its useless on cottons and silks  Its great to use it on chiffon and polyester Do not buy thinking you wont need standard ironing anymoreIt is fantastic for marriages where there are many dresses net based where you cant use iron Quick Good for suitsIt looks like an imitation product  pieces dont match properly and some look very weakvalu Ed for moneyIts not effective and pressing clothes effectively seems to have an issue,Ausente,Ausente,BAIXA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,BAIXA

upGood OneVery user friendly when compare with othersBest for home useGood for home usegood printerGoodGood for occasional printing Extremely easy to use,I bought this item in August 2022 and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as Ive come to expect from Amazon Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct supportThe only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup1 Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didnt actually lead to much of a guide rather a boilerplate page I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor2 Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever  I must have removed and reinserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected No error messages showed up and I didnt know if I had recieved a faulty product or if I was doing something wrong3 Never having owned a printer and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray leading to a jam at the first print itself Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets  clearer access to the online guide mightve helped hereExcept for the these minor concerns in setup Im enjoying using this printer surprisingly since printers alongside projectors  are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry Ive used all the features so far  print  colored double sided scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality wifi or the cartridges Information on the number of color and blackandwhite sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when I run outgood scanner

any further It has got all the functions youll find in a 2030k worth printers All in one includes print scan copy and fax as well Colour adf duplex printing wifi You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself Only two issue that I faced firstly the print qualitywhich Ill speak to the service center and secondly is the total quantity of color prints I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90 I guess Ill have to purchase a larger cartridgeVery good printer Sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage But overall very happygud printer but printing cost is expensive in this price range features are very niceI got this printer ion 02Nov2022 After 15days of usage Im unable to print as it is showing Color  black ink is low i have print less than 50pages and in description they told that 400pages yield which is totally wrongCannon E4570This was launched as a successor for E4270 I searched everywhere but couldnt find a credible source to explain the differences between the two I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me  wifi enabled so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop clear color print decent for childs homework photo quality not required and cheap to run E4270 seem to fit all the criteria so I ordered this Even the canon authorised showroom didnt have E4570 in stock so ordered the E4570 off AmazonSummary  fullfills top two criteria Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional printDelivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon so that was great It was just the printer box with no outer packing The box was sealed with cello tape and not sealed so I suspect it had been opened at some point Thankfully all the components were there and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact so i was ok with the deliverySetup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi I never had to use the usb cable Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website link for both given in manual which guides step by step on how to setup I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devicesColor prints are a bit faded on plain paper 75gsm This might be a function of the paper and not the printer The blackwhite prints are crisp and sharp The print speed is decentThe only negative is the amount of ink consumption While the box says 180 color prints and 300 bw both my cartridges are showing at 80 after 4 color print and around 30 bw Specially for color prints the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 23 prints I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 3040 full color pages Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option but it is messy and requires practice This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarelyA special mention for the ADF and duplex printing Both the features are extremely useful Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range and comes in very handy while printing larger documentsOverall I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage I will update the review if I run into any issues,Ausente,Ausente,BAIXA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,BAIXA

Whole Review For All the Details  Decide YourselfGoodFul HIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BASEAmazingGood,Realme Buds Wireless design and  specificationsTruly wireless earphones are becoming very popular and we could very well see Realme get into that space in the coming months However for now the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form  neckbandstyle earphones The headset has a flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends short cables that lead to the earbuds and the plastic earbuds themselves We quite liked the yellowandblack colour scheme of our review unit The design is simple and the build quality is decent The device is light at just 30g and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at a stretchLike earlier Realme earphones the Realme Buds Wireless have magnets in each earbud While they dont serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the Realme Buds Wireless Separating the buds turns the headset on while attaching them powers it down there is no power button so this is the only way to control power on the headsetIn theory this sounds good but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket This would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didnt want it to which was bothersome Calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphones earpiece without us knowing the battery would run down and the phone wouldnt automatically connect to other devices such as a Bluetooth car audio systemWhat you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips ear wings that are preattached to the earbuds and a MicroUSB cable for charging The charging port is on the underside of the right module which also has the controls for playback calls and volumeThe Realme Buds Wireless earphones are powered by 112mm drivers with Bluetooth 5 and support for the SBC and AAC codecs The earphones have a claimed battery life of 12 hours on a single charge and are said to offer 100 minutes of listening time on a 10minute charge when the battery is drained We were able to get around 9 hours of use in our testing while a full charge of the headset took a little under 3 hours to complete  Realme Buds Wireless performanceThe Realme Buds Wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price Also fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the Realme Buds Wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular DJ Alan Walker and the sound does come across as geared for this genre the wireless earphones with use AAC Bluetooth codecs We listened to streamed music from Spotify and YouTube Music as well as our collection of highresolution tracksStarting with Take Five by the Dave Brubeck Quartet we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what were typically used to hearing from products in this price range Some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined although the deeper elements in the middle of the track  the doublebass in particular  was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as wed have liked Still we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the wholeNext we listened to a bit of Indian pop with an Unplugged rendition of Amar Arshis Kala Chasma Apart from some gentle aggression in the low end we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track The sound of the Realme Buds Wireless is tuned for comfort and nearuniversal appeal and sticks to that brief We heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than Rs 2000the Realme Buds Wireless as a handsfree headset for voice calls and results were mixed In some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft and our callers reported too much background noise  a crow cawing about 20 feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us for the person on the other end On other occasions no issues were reported so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal  VerdictMore expensive pairs of earphones such as the OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 and 1More Stylish Dual Dynamic Driver might offer much more by way of sound quality but the Realme Buds Wireless does a capable job for just Rs 1799 This is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the priceThis headset is built well has decent battery life and is very comfortable to wear The only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times That aside the Realme Buds Wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what its supposed to  no more and no less  with unwavering consistency and we like it for thatPros1  Looks good2  Light and comfortable3  Detailed rich sound for the priceCons1  Magnetic power switch is troublesome2  Inconsistent performance on voice callsRatings out of 5Design comfort 40Audio quality 38Battery life 45Value for money 48Overall 40Go and purchasedFirst of all if you are a ElectronicDance and HipHop Genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone STILL CONTINUES its not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphonesFrom My music listening experience from 8 Years i can tell you that the Depth and that vibrating Surround base effect is not in this  it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if youre a HipHop EDM lover THE MID TONES OF MUSIC ARE A LITTLE LOW IN THIS EARPHONE WHICH ALSO RUINS A LITTLE THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE GENRES SONG LISTENING EXPERIENCETHIS WANNA MAKES ME THINK EVERYTIME IS ALAN WALKER REALLY TUNED THISFOR TRAP  HARD DANCE GENRE ITS GOOD BUT NOT THE BESTI can tell you such differences because I am also using a wired earphone namely MI Earphones PRO 1799 rs which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effectRATHER THAN FOR THOSE GENRES SONG THESE EARPHONES ARE REALLY GOOD FOR EVERY OTHER GENRES If Youre Fine with the above listed drawbacks Then only head towards the detailed reviewUPSIDES1 THE MATERIAL QUALITY IS GOOD ITS PLASTIC BUT FEELS LIKE A SOFT SILICON LAYER IS APPLIED OVER ITS TOP LAYER BOTH ON THE NECKBAND AS WELL AS THE WIRES OF THE EARPLUGS2 THESE ARE EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT AND DOESNT FEELS A LIKE EXTRA LOAD ON YOUR NECK AT ALL3 NOISE CANCELLATION IS REALLY VERY GOOD IM REALLY IMPRESSED4 MIC QUALITY IS ALSO THE BEST THAT CAN BE OFFERED IN 2000 RANGE No Complaints5 THE EARPLUGS FIT IS GOOD BUT I ADVICE YOU TO REMOVE THOSE REMOVABLE ANGULAR PADDINGS FOR MORE SNUG FIT AND COMFORT IS FINE BUT COULD BE MORE BETTER AS MY WIRED ONES ARE REALLY MORE COMFORTABLE AND IF YOU HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THIS THEN YOU CAN ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT ITS COMFORT FOR LONG USE6 THE BLUTOOTH RANGE IS REALLY GOOD STILL WORKS IF 2 ROOMS ARE IN BETWEEN7 THE MAGNETIC ONOFF CONTROL IS LIKE CHERRY ON CAKE AND WORKS LIKE CHARMWHEN YOU SEPERATE THEM IT TAKES 34 SECONDS TO CONNECT WITH YOUR PHONE IF ALREADY PAIRED BEFORE AND IF PHONES BT IS ON AND IF YOU ATTACH THEM TOGETHER THEY GO TO STANDBY MODE AND GOES OFF IF NOT OPENED AGAIN WITHIN 5 MINUTES ITS REALLY GOOD THAT YOURE GETTING THIS MAGNETICFUNCTION IN THIS PRICE8 SOUND CAN GO REALLY LOUD BUT I PREFER TO USE IT ON 6070 9 MICRO USB CABLE  2 PAIR OF EXTRA EARTIPS SMALL  LARGE ARE PROVIDED IN BOX MEDIUM IS PREAPPLIED AND IS PERFECT NEARLY FOR EVERYONE10 BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD EXPECT 8 HOURS OF CONTINUOS PLAYBACK ON 70 VOLUME11 CHARGING SPEED IS ALSO GOOD YOU CAN EASILY GET 1 HOUR OF PLAYBACK ON 1O MINUTES OF CHARGE AND CAN FULLY CHARGE IT AROUND 90100 MINUTES IF FULLY EMPTY12 DID NOT GET TO EXPERIENCE ITS SPLASH RETENTION PROPERTYDOWNSIDES1 THE OUTER COVER OF EARPHONES ARE OF PLASTIC GOOD QUALITY BUT THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALUMINIUM FRAME IN THIS PRICE2 THE WIRES SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN AS BRAIDED ONE FOR ROUGH AND LONG USE3 NO REALME BRANDING PERMANENT ANYWHERE ON THE EARPHONE CONFUSES US BUT THERES TAG ATTACHED ON THE NECKBAND4 THE CAP ON THE CHARGING PORT SHOULD HAVE GIVEN TO PREVENT DUST FROM ENTERING5 SMALL CARRY CASE OR POUCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO MAKE IT TRAVEL FRIENDLY6 WHEN CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE WHEN THERE IS AN INCOMING CALL IT DOESNT RECITES THE NUMBER OF CALLER AND IT SOMETIMES DOESNT NOTIFIES AT ALL BUT NO MAJOR CON IS THERESOUND QUALITY1 THE VOCALS ARE REALLY AMAZING  NOW I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS OF POP SONGS 2 THE LOWS AND HIGHS OF THE SONGS ARE REALLY GREAT BUT MIDS ARE LITTLE SUPRESSED AND YOU WOULD DEFINITELY MISS THAT IN EDM AND HIPHOP SONGS as that evary low details are not required in dance songs the Mids  Highs are more important3 THE BASE IS ADEQUATE AND KEEPS THE SONG ALIVE BUT NOT PRODUCES THAT WELL DEEP AND SURROUND BASE THAT YOUNGSTERS LOVE BUT IT DEFINITELY HAS THAT AMOUNT OF BASE REQUIRED IN ANY SONG TO FEEL IT IM ALSO A YOUNSTER AND IM FINE WITH IT AS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND SERIES ON TV SILENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING MY FAMILY SO THIS FULFILLS MY PURPOSE4 THE BEAT AND SOUND PRODUCED FEELS NATURAL AND CLEAR LIKE HIGH QUALITY HEADPHONES AND IN THIS RESPECT ALAN WALKER AND REALME TEAM HAD SURELY DONE A GREAT WORK5 BASED ON TYPES OF MUSIC LOVERS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO POP INDIEPOP ACOUSTIC RB Rock and soft Rock TRAPHARD DANCE  NEARLY ALL KINDS OF GENRES EXCEPT EDM AND HIPHOPAS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE SO I DO NOT HAD ANY GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND I CAN SURELY SAY THAT IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS AND IM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASEPLEASE READ THE WHOLE REVIEW IT WILL SURELY HELP YOU DECIDE MORE CLEARLYHAVE A GOOD PURCHASING EXPERIENCE THAKYOU FOR READINGBest but little high price6to 12 month daily use he chal pata h The base is so loud you cant listen for long you will get ear pain after 1 hour Who like highhhhhhhhh base they can choose and sound quality ok Quality  is goodBest productGood product

those brewed in CCDvalue for moneyNiceDoesnt justify the DescriptionGood for the priceUnnecessary BuyDelivery without Warranty Card,This machine can easily brew coffee for a family of 46 members at a time Some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe The answer is simple NO Reason is that this isnt a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewerNow my experience with this machine was good And a bad thing was that I did not get the steam pipe sleeve Except that everything was well packed When you buy this machine make sure to rinse the internal passage throw the first water from the machine thoroughly wash the caraffe puck filter and measurement spoon Remember to NEVER USE dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe puck or anything such It may ruin the coffee aromaMethod efficient as per my opinion1 Fill the water in tank No need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector Dont run it dry It may damage the heating element or pump2 Switch ON the machine After that pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter level it and press it to compress I use 12 ratio 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output3 Before changing over to drip mode open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built Placing carafe under the puck slowly move the selector till Europa and quickly back it to steam icon This will let the coffee bloom inside After 57 seconds slowly move the selector upto Espresso The decoction should be not too slow or not too runny4 Wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode5  Take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk Place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus Slowly open the steam valve located at the side Steam it as per your need6 Mix the milk and decoction Thats itRemember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside Open the steam valve and let all the pressure get releasedCoffee used Bombay Island Espresso grind Medium Roast Use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind Dont use Aeropress V60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired tasteI personally like this machine For the price its good and build quality is Moderate Please watch some YouTube videos if you are new to coffee machines Its very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge You may also watch James Hoffmann He is World Barista Champion and shares tips about coffeeIm a fan of espresso Every time I go to a coffee joint I tend to order a doppio A double shot espresso But those prices are way too high if I wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday So Ive decided to buy this machine One thing to say the quality and durability depends on the user If you take care the machine would take care of your cup of joeSo how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing1 Always rinse the drip tray2 Use 10 dish washing liquid with 90 water to clean the carafe3 Do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds Run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds This is crucial because dents can affect quality4 Before and after your brewing activities make sure that you clean the internals To do this fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water  Assemble an empty permafilter  Switch on and set the strength to max In about a minute you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe Check its color If its yellow then rinse and repeat If it is white dry everything and switch it off Then either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day5 Always let the steam out When you froth milk immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothWARNING NEVER EVER USE HARDTAP WATER IT CAUSES SERIOUS LIMESCALING ISSUES WHICH CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE TASTE QUALITY OF YOUR COFFEE IT MAY ALSO CAUSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES ALWAYS USE SOFTCAN WATERTHE WATER MUST NOT TASTE SALTY OR SWEET  TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY PLEASE DO NOT POST MISLEADING REVIEWS STATING THAT MY MACHINE BROKETHE STEAM KNOB IS THE WORST PART OF THIS MACHINE THE MACHINE WAS USED JUST FOR 14 DAYS THEN THE STEAM KNOB DECIDED TO LOOSEN UP AND FALL OFF I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT THERE THE PROBLEM IS IM JUST 17 AND I CANT DRIVE AND THE SERVICE CENTER IS FAR AWAY SO I REMOVED THE RUBBER CASKET AND FIXED THE KNOB DIRECTLY IT COMES OFF BUT I THINK ILL USE IT ONLY TO EASE THE PRESSURE BECAUSE I ALWAYS DRINK IT BLACK BUT THIS ISSUE MAKES ME REDUCE A STARTips for using the machine1 Use fine grounded coffee I use Narasus PB or Royal Elite Bold Currently  Im using Phalada Pure  Sure Organic Coffee Powder For the best results you must grind the coffee on your own If you cant make sure the coffee is fresh Mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster both for the machine and your stomach respectively You can also go for Lavazza But it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the Mariana Trench2 Only use good quality bottledcan water3 Maintain a good cleaning discipline4 In case youve used hardtap water immediately do a descaling Refer your instruction manual5 Always tamp your ground in the filter You must apply about 30 pounds of force This is about 13 kg of force Hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it Make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisAs you can see this is a real espresso maker It produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee For me it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot This is good for a steam driven machine Note that this is a steam driven machine You can never get the finish of coffee joints because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps Although the tastes would be similar provided you use the correct beansPlease look at the pics  to see the finish The cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old The brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder Ive just bought Can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness This applies even to taste The white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth The brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best leaving a crisp and nutty taste Also after I did some research I came to know that an espresso must have three layers A bitter crema a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom You must mix these before drinking to have the best shot If you see the glass picture Ive attached  you can clearly see those layersOVERALL THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MACHINE FOR A BEGINNER IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO AND IT IS ECONOMICAL TOO AS I SAID IF YOU TREAT THE MACHINE WELL THE MACHINE WOULD TREAT YOUR CUP OF JOE WELLBeing a coffee enthusiast the product fits in my requirementEasy to use Time taken is reasonable Adjustment of intensity works wellFrothing tool is very good though i prefer black coffee frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guestsNice productThe coffee strength nob is a mythBut itne paise me itna is goodVery happy with the machine works fine and easy to operate unfortunately it wasnt packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken  everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the boxIt makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult Also was shocked to know this is not covered under Amazons return policy My bad I didnt check and now I am stuck with this Life is no better after you buy thisCoffee maker delivered without Warranty Card  Instruction manual,Ausente,Ausente,BAIXA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,BAIXA

handy andneasy to use  the quality is as expected from logitechCool keyboardNot worth the hype but manageableA Robust HighQuality Ergonomic KeyboardThe best Keyboard for a Mac Environment,So I got this keybaord a few days ago and it came in a package that can be best described as being mauled by a bear It was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough I could just pop it back in no problem Thankfully it works fine I tested all the keys and they are functional so lets get to the meat of the subject or paneer if youre vegetarianI think this keyboards performance will vary according to your use case For me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since I had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet I checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard I bought it along with the Logitech Pebble M350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly I dont regret it Both of them fir very well into my work type and theyve made my life a lot more easierThis is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasseI checked The keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time The major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between 3 bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button Now I personally thought that I wouldnt be using this feature all that much since I was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet But then I realised that I could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts emails on my android tablet at the same time Nowadays I cant stop using this feature since I have my phone tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent It is honestly very neatThe keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than lets say square keys and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing This comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately Teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable It does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboardThe latency is quite low from my perspective I dont think they have that crispy Logitech Lightspeed tech built into it though but you wont be using this for gaming and if you are planning to then please dont This keyboard performs horribly in gaming and I mean its terrible This is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind If I am ambitious enough I can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket because of how small it is Like my friends say I have small hands well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord Sometimes while I am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything I am doing goes into stasis But that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard It does come with arrow keys which is very surprising They actually managed to squeeze it inI mean thats pretty much it for this keybaord Dont buy it for Rs3k I suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much I would say this is like a Rs14K keyboard but thats just my opinion If you are buying this for the android experience then I suggets buying it bunded with the mouse Because both of them kind of complete each other With that being said Im going to conclude my reviewMouse came turned on Apart from that no issues discovered till now it going goodIts one of the best budget keyboards I have ever used the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click not lift off weight  easy on the fingers  its been around 1yr since I bought this keyboard  and Iam using it ever since  no issues so far and Iam highly satisfied with my purchase definitely gonna recommend it  Very good typing experience so farhttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesI61lIMl3tS4LSY88jpgConsNo Caps Lock indicatorHeight isnt adjustableNo backlightThe key travel is very very less please keep that in mind Otherwise a decent product at the price rangeI bought this in combination with a Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my iPad It has made my tasks easier and with recent iPadOS updates there are tons of shortcuts that make iPad experience more productive Since I was going for a retrolooking device I chose Sand color Makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish Connectivity is fast You just switch it on and its connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds even less They keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environmentYou can connect upto 3 devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button Im also using the setup for gaming Will maybe update later about that experienceFinal Comments Ergonomic economic portable and lovely Recommend buy for all who need to get work done fastThis Keyboard is awesome  It has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability  Just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and I miss the backlight design  but it is a value for money product

that offers virtually everything I want,I ordered this phone based on specs it was providing later I saw flood of negative reviews coming up on Amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned if it was true1 Calls getting disconnected  I had call with my brother last night and we talked for 50 min and call did not disconnect in the middle2 Heating issue  While in day to day use never faced heating issue but It gets a little hot while charging I can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable Every phone with fast charging heats a little3 Camera Quality  It has a decent 64 mp Samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes You can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good Attached pic of cake which I clicked indoor only bright light source was candle It performed well I can sayTo people who complaint about camera   I just cannot expect picture clarity of Apple or Samsung high end devices i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid4 AnTuTu Benchmark Score  While company claim of 740000 while I tested i got a score of 700000  I again cannot complaint here because I dont know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing 700000 is pretty decent score I can say5 Phone lag  In two days of testing it has not lagged at all With multiple background apps running6 Battery Drain  Revisit few of the settings on your device like animation transition effect etc to get most out of your battery If your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most Again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company While I started to write this review my cell phone was at 100 Now its almost 25 min typing till now its now showing 99 i have set my screen at full brightness i fell its decent Also tested charging speed 0 to 50 in 1203 min7 Build quality  Its sturdy and decent plastic is used I can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint Card Discount  Exchange Benefit etc  Still I would take out 1 star here8 Black colour issue  Did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour Its AMOLED screen Black is highlight of AMOLED In case you were using IPS  FHD panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing I have Samsung M51 as secondary device and i see black similar on both9 BGMI  I played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag10 Two year warranty  They calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only 1 year I have personally wrote to Iqoo team and Amazon team seeking an answer with screenshots waiting for answerBTW majority of phone manufacturers provide 1 year warranty only even iPhone Here I would say fight for you justice and seek answer from Iqoo or Amazon Team11 Video call lag  Did not face any did multiple video calls yesterday with different people did not get any complaint from them about my video lag For all of them my video popped up instantaneousOverall I would say I had a great buy and can recommend this device to others  for all the folks bombarding negative reviews I would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied In case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justiceOverall i give this device a 4 star as of now since I am yet to test this device long term like 3 months or 4 monthsPlease excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any Entire review was typed on my phone Iqoo Neo 6I have been using a budget phone realme 3 since 2019 dynamic black 3GB64GB It served me well but it was time for an upgrade I was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything I wanted within my budget Did I get one Lets dig into itTHE GOOD Price After discounts I got a phone with practically all the features I wanted IQOO is basically from Vivo an internationally recognized brand Hopefully I dont have to worry about software updates for at least 3 years IQOO is already doing good as I have received 3 security updates so far for the Android 12 that came out of the box I will keep an eye on the security updates and OS upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for VivoIQOO for my next phone Dual 5G SIM support which is futuristic With 4G the call quality has been superb so far E4 AMOLED 120 Hz 1300 nits peak 1080x2400 pixels display with 60000001 contrast ratio 360 Hz touch sampling rate and HDR10 Netflix HDR supported A huge upgrade from my previous phone The photos OTT movies look too good Easier to read contents like messages emails or documents 64 MP main cam with OIS OIS was a musthave feature for me since I could be taking a lot of lowlight photos 4700 mAh battery with 80W FlashCharge Technology 50 in 12 min 100 in 32 min Works as claimed The battery life has been satisfactory SD 870 CPU Not one of the flagship processors today but highly capable and fantastic at this price Inclusion of 12 GB RAM has made this phone a butterysmooth one for running apps Android is quite a RAM dependent OS unlike iOS Up to 4 GB of phone storage can be used for extended RAM Currently I have 100 apps installed mostly productivity apps but no gaming apps The cascade cooling system seems to be working 256 GB ROM with UFS 31 Since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microSDXC slot and this phone is no exception I did not want the 128 GB variant A fast large internal ROM is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps files slower The indisplay fingerprint reader works well The stereo speakers are reasonably good Infrared port IR blaster I have not tried using it as a remote but a must try USBC port with USBC to USBA data cable that connects to the phone charger Some of us prefer a USBC to USBC data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices but I can see why IQOO decided to provide a USBC to USBA Most laptops still come with USBA ports even my recent hp 250 G8 laptop from the company I work for does have a USBC port without power delivery and two USBA ports My powerbanks dont have USBC ports either Screenshots lock screen virtual buttons Must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttonsTHE BAD Google backup A FAIL Since I did not have a USBC to USBC cable I had to choose the WiFi data transfer option from my old phone to this one Although I selected all the files Google failed to transfer many files especially the PDFs Dear Google this is unacceptable Spam handling My realme 3 lets me block any SMS I want but this one does not In my opinion every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an SMS as needed I have stopped using a 3rd party app like Truecaller which has become a truly rogue app No 35 mm jack a plus when you dont have a bluetooth earphone or dont prefer one but IQOO thankfully included a USBC to 35 mm adapter in the box The absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing but I do not mind as I barely drop my phone and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector and a transparent back cover Really appreciated The plastic body does not bother me moreover the dark nova color feels cool YMMV In my realme 3 and not in my realme C2 which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific OS versions if I try turning off the daily wakeup alarm it gives me options like Turn off on the next day for which the alarm is active Do not repeat any more or Cancel This is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day say an upcoming leave or holiday without turning it off for the following days Unfortunately this artificial intelligence is not available in my IQOO Neo 6 5GAlways buy a recently released model if you are going for an Android phone This will make sure that you get software support for long enough time Moreover avoid buying the variant with lowest RAMROM And fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the timeI have used this phone for  2 months and will update this review as I keep using it Till date I am quite satisfied with IQOO Neo 6 5G I also liked the Funtouch OS and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DLLa8HNWL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/iQOO-128GB-Storage-Snapdragon%C2%AE-FlashCharge/dp/B07WDKLDRX/ref=sr_1_63?qid=1672895762&s=electronics&sr=1-63,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,ALTA

satisfactory Only worried is that the cost of its Ink CartridgesPrinting photos ar totally not clearPros1 The Best  only wifi all in one printer in the range of 5k with ink saver so called2 Low usage required  low maintenance Thought of buying ink tank but learnt from friends that its suitable for heavy printing and when they didnt use it for a while repairs needed Hence decided to go for inkjet with low cost maintenance This doesnt require daily print like ink tanks3  product is solid built and no issues observed so far Many long term reviews also confirmed flawless working for years so decided this model4 Print quality Black is very good but colour is average Does the job for kids school project purpose5 Easy setup  Its very easy to setup if you are techy Setting up WiFi took little bit of time an hour I hate reading manuals and it was first time with a printer at home6 WiFi printing via mobile is a breeze with Canon Selphy app Easy photo editor by canon is also quite useful handyCons1 Black is good but Colour is pretty average Like I said good enough for home students purpose2 Not happy with cartidges supplied by Canon They seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose It gave around 100 pages for black and 1520 pages of color with lowest quality settings where in they claim 250 Black and 100 color Both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same2 Ink cartidges cost  yield The cost cartridges seems to be increasing when I was purchasing this it was around 500 for black but now its around 600 and I had no faith on the yield based on what I have got with stock cartidges Its not worth buying cartidges so go for refill3 We only find CL 57S Which is small Where is Cl 57 large size  Couldnt find anywhere

normalGood celphoneNice phonePhone is good at the price rangeAffordableMulti featured mobile at economical price,After using the phone for a day I feel corners have been cut in various areasJN1 sensor is not that great in low light Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsungs new F23Thermal management is very poor Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high Same is the case when camera app is openedsimple games on flipkart gamezone are played There are reports on youtube of narzo50s camera shutting down on hot daysAbove scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazySpeaker and earpiece do not have crispiness upper treble instead sound like white noise Earpiece volume is low So is the speaker volume when on call On the other hand speaker volume is decent while playing back videosFlashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones I dont really know if company did cost cutting here or its a software bugNo fm radio and secondary micMinor features I missed if shifting from miui to realmeui  eg the gallery app is not as good as miui one requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folderMediocre ram management with realmeui 2 android 11To be fair I could not find any major bug in realmeui 20 so far The lcd display is fantastic and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point as opposed to yellowish 55006500k super amoled There was no green or purple tint Touch response was excellent Screen protector case fast charger usb c cable were present The phone feels much slimmer than my bulky F22 due to its thin body 10gm less weight and sleek case Camera app has full fledged manual mode something absent from Samsungs F22Disclaimer Above impression has been made after using 4 smartphones over last 8 years Asus Zenfone 5 Redmi 4 Redmi 7A Samsung F22Strongly consider other current alternatives too like Redmi note 11 Poco m4 pro Poco m4 pro 5g Redmi note 10t 5g  Samsung F22 Samsung F23 Moto G42 before buying Narzo 50More info Do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone Check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking I agree Turn off content recommendation by going to the Settings  Additional Settings  Get Recommendations and switch the green toggle off To remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way follow excellent guide by youtuber tech office mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands I was able to uninstall hot appsgames this wayUPDATEDetailed camera comparison between Samsung F22 and Narzo 50Samsungs HDR algo seems more sophisticated narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much there is also some oversharpeningBoth cameras choose cool auto white balance which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in golden hours However narzos colors become more hue accurate after choosing 60006500k white point in expert mode whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance Narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in expert mode but samsung fully turns it off in pro mode resulting unusable photosHowever when using night mode narzos photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night  Gcam 85 for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows much worse than realmes night mode On the other hand thereas no gcam and no camera2api support for F22 At night you can take long exposure shots upto 81632secs through expert mode by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo something you cant do in F22 This however requires tripod support and whenever done properly the results are very goodYou have manual film mode in narzo whereas you cant even manually set white balance in F22s video mode as samsungs lower end galaxys dont have pro video modeThis mobile is suitable for every oneIts goodBut camara is averagehttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesI719puSga96LSY88jpgGood qualityVery good phone Iam very happy with this while usingthank you AmaonI had purchased this phone in 10k and this phone is actually brilliant in this price range Camera is good fingerprint sensor is good back panel is good i purchased black one  no hang but there is a small problem that battery drains little faster and when you click Home button google assistant appears most of the time which is quite annoying sometimes overall i am happy with the phone I wanted an affordable phone  this fits the bill perfectlyFantastic

installKind of useless for a PC with a GPUHow to returnValue for moneyBigGood stuff for its purpose it is working,My office PC UPS Legrand  Numeric UPS Digital 600EXV is having only one LED and beep codes This is not sufficient if we want more details However the unit is robust easy to disassemble easy to replace battery with generic battery having best transfer time less than 4 milli Sec 37min backup for CPU  Monitor when checked In view of this  the Legrand Numeric UPS Digital 600EXV should my the number one choice But it also has low  user ratingsThe  following brands  came to my notice on search1 APC BX600CIN2 APC BX600CIIN3 Emerson Liebert iTon CX 600I have not considered microtek intex iball vguard etc may be they are goodThe technical parameters of the above all looked similar  like generator compatibility AVR Highlowoverload protections But the transfer time specified for Numeric is less than 4 milli sec for  APC 10 milli sec typical and for Liebert 48 millisecondsAPC BX600CIN  is selected as my requirement is not for PC or laptop further search is not done for UPS with communication port and auto save software  and  in view of better interface   Power LED Dual color Charging LED Dual colour Battery saver LED   It also has  better backup and surge power than APC BX600CIIN minus resettable thermal relayBased on the reviews there are four major issues i have noticed1 very old stock Battery capacity expected to be in reduced condition resulting into low backup time or battery issue2 Transit damages as it is bulky to its volume Though it is better to purchase such items offline I still tried online in view of remote location3 No load protection   It acts  if very low load is connected eg just modem  or less than 30w and battery saver mode is on   after 5 min  people get confused it as giving only 5 min backup it shouldnt be considered as a problem once known since additional loads can be connected or battery saver mode can be unselected4 If Battery saver is enabled  it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left it shouldnt be considered as  a problem  since it can be unselected if selected intentionally or unintentionallyTo reduce the above risks Ms Appario Retail Private Ltd was chosen at lightening deal at Rs Rs265900 The order was placed on 100419 The product is delivered in 4 days on 130419 The original packing was wrapped in repeated turns of polyethylene The packing reached without any major distortions The original cartoon packing was in sealed condition However when it was opened some parts looseness sound was coming from the UPS The same was reported to APC service center They registered the complaint and told me that the service person will visit within 48 hours of working days Further they have given clearance to put the UPS in serviceFirst it was charged fully  while UPS in off condition charging light was on while charging and it became off after charging Now the UPS was made on by power button it is to be pressed and hold for not less than 1 second before release or release after beep tone connected to PC with 32 inch LED TV initially some repeated chattering without any power interruption to the load was happening if power input is kept off on battery It was happening some timesWhen it is on battery  beep sound was occurring every 22 sec against APC Manual spec of 60 secit withstood for 18 minutes for the PC with 32 inch LED TV on battery Battery save mode was in off conditionFurther it got switched off within 5 sec of low battery alarm against 60 sec specified in the manualThe manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was Nov 2018 photo attached but the test and quality passing date is 11012018 1253 hrs photo attachedAs my load is more than 30w  I can put it on battery saver mode the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan 2 seconds before release to change the state  this  is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manualThe UPS body temperature appears to be on higher side when compared to Numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mainsThe above is initial experience only any updates shall be shared in futureNote1 This item isnt eligible for returnFor safety reasons items containing flammable liquids or gases cant be returned to Amazon For more information or help please contact themIf you want return facility search for other alternativesUpdate 1The service person called me on 140419 and informed about his planned visit on 150419The service person visited in the morning of 15042019 and disassembled the UPS there was a  minor play with the battery  the whole casing is of plastic one side cover opens including top as one part the play may be due to design  manufacturing tolerances The PCB and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight Hence the looseness is acceptable The battery manufacturing date was Oct 2018 I agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery but manufactured in Sept 2018 The chattering may be relevant to building wiring as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove UPS input plug from the same socket see next update for accurate reason   In the whole  the service persons only concern was hotter transformer based on his experience but it will be replaced only if it failsPrompt response of service center is appreciable that too for an interior of 76 km from service center located at state capital and it compliments the non return policyUpdate 2It is fully charged with replaced battery  and backup time was tested with the same load as above But this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and  parameters difficult to reason out as belowBackup time is 32 Min until some different  type of blinking of power led   different type of beeps happens for few seconds may be relevant to battery saver mode  and however it got normalized in auto  after 5 min further  the battery low blinking of power LED occurred hence total 37 min against 18 min of earlier experience as above and these beeps occurred for 40 seconds before it tripped against 5 seconds of earlier experience as above but power LED was glowing for every few seconds till further 20 seconds in off conditionBattery on  beep was occurring for every 5990 seconds 1 min to indicate the load is on battery against every 22 second earlier experience as above I was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly bulky and  distant service partner type equipment at my home  He has replaced only battery and he has not even removed the PCB But how  so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned outNote 2I NonRMSMultimeter does not properly read the voltage of a UPS that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery Hence  output voltage of a 230 VAC UPS is measured to be between 170180 VAC when on batteryIi Low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage  high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of UPS while on batteryIii chattering may take place at UPS if any separate surge protection is used at UPS outletIv some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to UPSV APC service person informed that APC UPS will not on if house is not properly grounded earthing is to be proper to protect from surgesVi if UPS is on battery with battery saver mode enabled  ie mains off it will give only 5 min backup to loads less than  30w as no load protection acts  however if the load is more than 30w  it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left  ie if we disable battery saver mode  we will get 5 min more backup powerFrom the above  the UPS is now functioning as per specifications but one star of APC is reduced against initial issues of equipment though super fast response exists from their service center  5 stars to  Ms Appario Retail Private Ltd the seller 5 stars to the APC service center and 5 stars to courier  Ms Delivery for safe and fast deliveryUpdate 3 After 4 months of use  backup time testing ignoring erroneous tests in betweenThe ups was made on and battery saver was made off  due to this  the ups started self charging further and I have waited till the charging is completed Now  the TV as monitor with PC were made on  it took upto 045 amp during cold boot  amp measured with clamp meter while mains is on once the PC stabilised 03A the mains is switched off Now it gavea  backup of 17 minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at 17th min Again every min one beep started for 5 min After this repeated beeps occurred  for 30 second and ups got tripped Hence I got 22 minutes and 30 seconds in total In view of this the star rating is retained at 4 starOne more observation is that its transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means more energy is being wasted by transformerI got the battery replaced one more time on 15012020 under warranty as backup time reduced to 11min under the same conditions and load With new battery I am getting 24 minutes Hence the Apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where Apc quality person should have control After warranty I will install battery from exide and seeProsThe device is sleek small and blends into the environmentConsMakes a lot of noiseI bought this primarily to support my television Sony XR65X90K to handle the switch from generators to mains For  30 Secs It is not sufficient to do that and the TV switches on and off continuously when running on UPS power Im not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficientIf you have a similar use case as mine better consult a local inverter shop and get a UPS that fits your requirement Else you will end up with dead weightEasy to installMy PC has a 550W PSU with 80 Bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond 280watts under max load This UPS shuts down as soon as my GPU GTX 970 reaches 100Then I used it for my printer But as soon as I hit print the UPS shuts down So its useless there as wellNow its attached to my TV router and speakers Atleast I can watch Netflix uninterruptedIm getting trouble in this I think this is not working properly where should I returnValue for money so far working goodSmall but big life of batteryIt is good for electricity

productApart from the camera everything is fineProduct is goodHonest Review after 14 days usageSuperb but need improvement in cameraBest camera,I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones My budget was around 20k max and this one somehow fit in all ways I had almost finalized one plus nord ce but changed my mind at the last moment and I dont regret Ive used redmi phones before so Im aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer Got this for 13k with close to 6k exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone one of the worst phones Ive ever used refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that Heres my review of this phone based on 2 months of usagePros1 Build quality is good Finishing and lookwise its sleek and quite comfortable in hand2 Back camera is really good better with the AI camera The 108 MP gives good pictures although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality but for the price range its not bad Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions decent in low light with night mode3 67W charger is very efficient Phone gets fully charged within 4045 mins from below 10 battery levels Battery backup is decent with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more4 Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers Pretty loud too5 No lagging and smooth touch refresh rate is pretty good6 Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general there are negligible auto installing bloatwares Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory7 Hasslefree usage in general something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalitiesCons1 Front camera couldve been a lot better In daylight conditions picture colors arent vibrant enough and in low light pictures come grainy Dissatisfied with that2 Amoled display isnt as good as I had expected especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while youre watching somethingNothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now May update this review if anything encounteredFor people with 1520k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 LiteNice phone with good battery backupfast charging sturdy body and good process speed camera quality is not good enoughbut overall good budget phone1 Battery is decent2 Charging is very fast3 Camera is averagingOverall nice productThe phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the oneThe price of the product is higher at the time of launch Within 1 month it dropped by 3kThe price qty is okSome features are missing which are available in Chinese make modelPros1 Displaysuper amoled2 Battery life24 hrs moderate usage3 Fast charging4 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1 Miuilots of unnecessary apps2processorsd 695 is too old3main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if youre looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for itpubg cod feels fantastic in this without any lagIf looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brotherGood phone need improvement in cameraThis mobile has the best camera

very very good in terms of ergonomicGood keyboard but have some consGood For Daily UseEasy to use hard to carryniceExcellent Durable and connects to any gadgets including IPhoneNot suitable for allAbsolute Rubbish  Moderately Good Product,I bought it when I watched an instagram influencer showed this product and wanted to try hands on thisQuality wise its really good and since its made by Logitech which has been in the market from too many years in PC Accessories  so less doubtful about its durability The best features once you pair your 3 different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth switching connectivity is super fast  like you wont feel any lag in connectivity The instructions strap helps to well understand this product I bought at 26k but I know its price had dropped to 17K during Diwali SaleThings I hate about this product  I felt it would be lightweight but it isnt Buttons are rounded but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great For gaming buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which dont matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys its always WASD but yes will be problematic if you play FIFA where there is extreme usage of arrow keysSo 45 for overall experienceGood portable keyboard I can list out the pros and consPros 1 Good Connectivity with Macbook pro latest OS2 Macbook keys are mapped properly as expected3 Portable4 Simultaneous connectivity with 3 devicesCons1 Not an ergonomic keyboard Its flat and doesnt have any option to incline up2 Dont have backlight keys You can not see the keys in dark room3 Keys are slightly hard to press I think due to rubber dome4 Enter key I feel is smaller which cant be sensed without seeing the keyboardOverall my purpose got fulfilled as i am able to use it with my Macbook pro after struggling with logitech R270 comboThe keyboard is really good and it has a good built quality and the only con is that there is no indication of whether the caps lock is on or offPros easy to use keys feels like mechanical keyboard Can connect 3 devices Supports Mac and windows Place holder for mobile devices  However I use it to place a penCons Expensive Very heavy  feels like Macbook air There is lag in connection whenever you turn on your laptopprice is litter highWhat an excellent product I got my hands on Smooth working and connect to 3 different gadgets at the same time and u can work on any of them Buttons are of good size so typing is easy and fast The inbuilt holder for gadgets is really solid and helping And its connect to IPhone alsoOnly uses for typing if horizontal view is suitable to see what we typingThink twice before buyingNot working properly on macbook pro Switches to junk characters frequently which is really frustratingHow did I fix The keyboard switches to symboljunk characters when the option key is pressed So I had to disable the option key in the keyboard and live with itApart from that above problem Its a good looking keyboard The keys are smooth to handle Due to its container for tabletphones the product is not as compact as you might be

achieved and the size of space coveredExcellent in every aspectVery goodLove the control from the appPurifier is good  but received a second hand itemWorks WellGood product Just works fine,Used it to keep the air inside as clean as possible This model does provide clean air over a reasonable sized space if the windows and doors are kept closedGreat product with a capability to reduce dust by approximately 34 eg if atmosphere pm25 is 300ppm  it will be reduced to upto 75ppm inside room  only if minimum ventilation is provided to take care the CO2 we generateIn my case  I have found in my area that the ambient has CO2 at 410 ppm If we open one window door to only by 5mm clearnce  the CO2 is being maintained from 500 to 600 ppm  with 2 adults inside the room  based on wind velocity and direction This adjustment 5mm clearance was achieved measuring with calibrated stand alone  CO2 cum PM 10 25  10 measurement meterOne more example with above ventilation arrangement the machine is in auto and ambient air pm25 at 198ppm room also at 198 ppm  the  fan speed reached  medium sound audible it took some time to reach  85ppm  and then it took  1min from 85 ppm to  68 ppm  now fan speed changed to low speed in Auto sound is inaudible this ppm  starts increasing gradually to 85ppm  in 15 minutes now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm 25 is 198ppmSimilarly the fan speed so its sound can be very high if ambient pollution is very highIt needs external cleaning of its HEPA filter every month based on pollution The sensor may need cleaning every 3 months for accurate readings if sensor mal functions  it is to be cleaned first and check  before taking to any service centerIt has a simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast 3 times the specified life if we clean the HEPA filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularlyIt does not have ozone producing UV rays or ion generators which if not properly designed  specified to customes not worry  may pollute the air with ozoneIt has particulate count PM 25 meter which is very accurate  in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room The readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter  CO2 PM10 PM25 and PM10We have to keep it on Auto to facilitate to change flow speed based on pollution level itstemperature and humidity meters  are also usefulUpdate 240422 still under warranty  It developed some abnormal sound just audible  when we go near to it like kitch kitch kitch at lowest speed Doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared when it is made upside downBottom cover opened  side covers opened  the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in  slightly loose condition as anticipated The abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut with 13mm tubular spanner already available with me  holding the fan  nut is a  self locking type and assembled back   But opening of side covers is a tricky and risky job some locks may be broken use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges  they may open in jerky motion  I have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting modification  so that I can open the panels easily in future However another Mi Air purifier 2S is working almost continuously without any problem from last 3 yearsUpdate 020722 High abnormal sound observed This time I want send it to service center  but while lifting some material flied off from grill So when I run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants  their wings and one baby lizard Now again it is working normalActualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter in practicality we just plug and use it Yes air quality is improving But it does not reduce any Allergic issuesReally liked the product i like how it shows the current AQI has a auto mode night mode that is super helpful with a babyThe air purifier is 45  is quiet filters well and quickly Will wait and watch for long term reliability plus the replacement filters are expensiveBut the seller shipped an item in an open box turned out to be a used product Filter says 90 remaining meaning it had been used to a good extent earlier Not sure why second hand items are sold as newWORKS WELL SINCE 5 MONTHS MORE COMMENTS WILL BE UPDATED SOONERI like because the performance is good and effective very easy to installIt works well but pollution level indicator is not reliable and keeps changing number very quickly in vide range

Awful installation service from amazonAcer Television ReviewIts a good product for that priceGood for the priceAlmost a complete packageNice ProductGood productSuper designed,About the TV  WonderfulProbably the best TV in this price range INR13000Good  Google interface loaded with features lightweight 55 watt power consumption stable designAverage  Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that goodFeatures Most of the streaming apps available and compatible You can connect with WiFi LAN Cable HDMI Set top box Laptop USB Gaming console Old dish cable and direct TV antenna as well Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone 1 Via cast feature on mobile apps  no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2 Via chromecast app  project only selected media pics videos or entire phone screenWays to connect PCLaptop 1 Windows cast option  project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option  need to be connected on same WiFi network2 Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service  Awful1 The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially However it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2 I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws  which I had bought  with him After about half an hour of arguments he finally drilled the other required holes And for all this he kept cussing me that I wasted his time There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as wellThis whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments This was the worst installation experience in my life so farBottomline  Please do not avail the so called free installation service from Amazon It is just a scam Instead call the acer support They will do the job much betterAfter using it for 2 months here are its pros and consPros 1 Great picture quality Its awesome2 Blacks are very good and is adjustable3 Sound with 30db is very good4 Looks great with thin besel5 Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons6 Content upscaling is very goodCons1 Remote could have been better Cant use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box2 Remote operation is bit complex3 Motion technology not great There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT but it decreases when you switch to DTHOverall its a nice buy at this price point I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound I am satisfied with the productProduct has good picture quality Good product at that price with 25w sound Applications running smoothly 3 months older  no issues yet Its running smoothlyYou get decent features for the price you pay Screen resolution might be Set back as you may find pixalation Overall its goodI am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p HD Ready TV It is truly an amazing panel I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther it will feel like a very small size The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions However since the speaker is downward firing the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a standThe remote is good voice search works well for me TV start up takes a long time in my opinion but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls Only negative aspect I faced is wrt the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones Firstly the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a  restart  which means I have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple Secondly the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inchesHowever I am still super happy with this TV I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my sideAt this price range11499it is good quality product on this marketacer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all okPicture quality really impressivewifi connectivity goodeasy to installboderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes laggingNo major issues found on this TVJust go

Amazon for full price under no offers still beat competitors by Rs163Order was placed on Thursday 011222 late in the evening at 11 pmWas to be Delivered on Thursday 081222 but arrived early on Monday 051222 at 10 amQuite satisfied with the Delivery Packaging Condition of the item and also Happy with the early arrivalAlong with the Vacuum we received a basic Instruction Manual and Warranty CardThe Invoice was missing from the parcel so it had to be downloaded from AmazonTo Register your Warranty you require to scan the Bar Code on the Invoice and WhatsApp the detailsWithout any delay excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was a fairly easy task took approximately 10 minutes which I guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etcFirst impressions the Vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise but some attachments could be a little stronger Especially the extension pipes could be Stainless Steel same as the Drum and Telescopic in feature  operation The main Vacuuming head attachment used for floor  hard surfaces could also be Stainless Steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit would extend its lifeIts a 2 pin plug instead of a 3 pin which could have been better with a surge protector fuseThe cord is of decent length quite impressed with the quality of the cord Also the cord which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit after use can be rested on top of the Drum in a winding fashion it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance Hose same solutionThe 2 side Latches are reasonably strong Wheels are easy to install  insert and work fineIt would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored  latched to the main unit while not in use storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regardFirst demo was for the VacuumNoise average not too loud or unbearable reasonable with any other domestic Vacuum of similar powerInside the lid the dust bag clings on to its inlet would be better if it could be secured  locked with a clipIn Vacuum suction mode the air gets forced out of the Blower outlet this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level Now imagine if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail If this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable Ac vents like in cars then it could direct the blown out air upwards while Vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design senseSuction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is importantThen follows the demo for the BlowerThis feature should technically be equally as strong as the Vacuum because the force of the air sucked in while Vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the Blower outlet To make things interesting there are fish gill like 2 vents on either sides of the Lid These vents are the fixed kind cannot be closed or opened One of the vent very faintly can be felt takingin air while the other vent blows out air at a significant force This particular phenomena I am bewildered with cause as I understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the Blower outlet So make of it what you will Still does the job if youre looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours petFinally the demo for the WetPerformance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is important May need to dry mop even after using the Wet functionIn closingDefinitely do purchase it use it often as required and also helps keeping fitDo not allow dust to settle on your Vacuum BlowerAlso ordered extrai American Micronic Replacement Dust Bag for AMIVCD211600WDx  AMIVCD151600WDxii RODAK 35 MM Mattress and Upholstery Nozzle for Vacuum Cleaner Wet and Dry Cleaning EU ImportIt have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners I bought this for my mother inlaw She likes it for being easy to use Its simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes Extension pipes are little loose though Its easy to clean those cat hairs now And dont have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor because its Wet and dry vaccum cleaner Hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise They send me already opened package but not used I think They could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package No complaints untill now I liked the reusable dust cover feature also its easy to connect it inside Easy to handle dont have too much weightIt would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switchThis is a domestic beast great suctionOnly thing that should had been ther is speed controlNoise level is high but with such suction is ok As long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again I am okRest how it will stay with time will be something to seeIt is very easy to clean as the suction power is great  very powerful machine indeedI have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now I recently came across this and read the reviews etc Some were good and some were bad But at the same time I couldnt find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners  in this price segment so I finally bought itIt came in a big Amazon box well packed and secured Unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images Here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible  Very Good quality steel and plastic build The suction28kpa is really really good even with the thick carpets etc The wheels are really good tooThey move effortlessly  You get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and theyre good quality  The blower function is really powerful  The bag insidewhich collects the dust  dirt is big and can be cleaned  Washed easily  The noise level isnt much Its okay Not loud The cord length is 5mtrs which is enough  The overheating protection is Good All the Accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the baseCons The only thing that I think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes They are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats youre cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again Overall a 1010 Product which fits all your needsWet and Dry Cleaning of course Better than any other Vaccum cleaners in under 10k price range  Go for it  Ps Ive tried some other Vaccum cleaners too which are in the 6k and above range but this is the all in one OP Vaccum CleanerGood suction with great built qualityGood durabilitygood suction power and quality productVacuum cleaner is very fine suction power is quite good drying power is also just OKnoise level is high as I expected Cost is high as compared to other brands Overall I rated it four

JBL CS100 vs Sennheisers cx180  DETAILED Comparison after 1 YEAR of USE,For those looking for a genuine review  a brief comparison summary between the best three earphonesheadphones in the budget segment Lets help you to makeup your mind The review is for Sennheiser 275 S earphone but items for comparison are1 Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone 2 Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone3 Sony MDRXB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones  Just for an introduction i would like to mention I am a dire fan for flagship Electronic goods  manages to fulfill my passion for the Taste of quality from time to time Now lets begin When you start looking for earphones or headphones Sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so The brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment I too started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power  excluding those insanely pricey onesRead some very good reviews of the Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional OverEar Headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought itFound it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks may refer my review of HD202 at amazon which were not upto my tasteNext Unsettled  I went to purchase these Sennheiiser CX 275 S in earphones and here are my observationsDESIGN   CONSTRUCTION a Looks  feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently then in the long runits sure to failb Wires which are around 12 m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use itc Comes with 3 different sized earpieces to snug fit different earanatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the bestd Inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fite Comes with a gold plated Lshaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf Comes with a small pouch  which for the most part was a useless accessory for me A case or box would have been more a more elegant option Squeezing the whole earphone into the lill pouch everytimenaah  feels primitive but then its my own two piecesSOUND QUALITY  PERFORMANCExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe sound quality is crisp  clear  with clear mids and crisp pitches bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug itin to watch some movie or NATGEO documentariesThe lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimesThe frequency response as per specs was 17 to 23000 Hz against 4 to 24000 Hz of Sony MDRXB50APJust to quote Sonys bass could get really deep  low with its 12mm drivers and neodymium magnets For purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony A little makeup wont Hurt   LOLSound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apexVERDICT xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Lack of a decent bass  extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of 1600 bucks For me Not worth itDETAILS  COMPARISON xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI happened to test the quality  performance of all the 3 renowned Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone  lastly Sony MDRXB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphonesBASS xxxxxxxxxxxxxxSonySennHD 202  SennCX 275S The extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels Cheap redundant or unpleasant to the ears Its a quality refined timbre  bass  not some low quality stuff HD 202 bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing othersSOUND QUALITY xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxExcellent on all 3 but Sony a bit appealing with its  phenomenal immersive bassBUILD  DESIGN xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Again SonySennHD 202  SennCX 275S Sonys wire were tangle free earphone pieces felt indestructible noise isolation was UltimateNext was SennHD 202 and least by any standards was SennCX 275SThe fragile design of the wires around Mic In sennCX 275 may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many1 SennHD 202 II might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issueBass is anytime better than SennCX 275 S but not as mesmerising as SonySound quality though is very goodcrisp and clear2 SennCX 275 S might be good for purists but even with its balanced Highs and midsSerious lack of bass keeps you longing for more especially if you are more into moviesgames and documentaries than musicMoreover its extremely fragile  always tangling thin wires  is a constant annoying feature3 Sony MDR XB50AP gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality midsIts indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wiresDo not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure musicIts a quality bass with frequency response as low as 4 to 24000 Hzadds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other twoProbably like a Super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy  full of lifeAnyways at the end of the day its your callkeep listeningNOTE There are thousands of reviews for this product but surprisingly theres hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180 so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review You get a  L  shaped connector in these earphones so note thatI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopicBUILT QUALITY  boAt  Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense Metal housing holds up good but colour sheds off after 56 months Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting JBL  Small round cables shredding off after 78 months of moderate usage Plastic housing doing great so farConnector is bent but not in perfect L shape so its quite pain to use while resting Sennheiser  Small round cables holding up good after 1 year of rough use Plastic housing has become slick as rubber coating on it has shredded off Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting WINNER boAt 225 COMFORT  boAt  comfortable enough when used while in upright position These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so Has very long earphone head JBL  Comfortable enough in upright position Slightly uncomfortable using while resting as these have offset opening Sennheisers  Comfortable in both the position These are apt for long duration usage WINNER  sennheisers cx180 LOUDNESS CX180  boAt 225  JBL CS100SI boAt  tends to distort above 75 level of volume JBL  Crystal clear even at full volume but has least sound level in all of three Sennheisers  tends to distort above 75 level of volume but has greater sound level of all WINNER  sennheisers cx180 SOUND QUALITY  Bass mids  lows  I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids  lows which are strong  Crisp But bass levels are different boAt  has average bass I am very disappointed with it since these earphones are marketed as bassheads JBL  has least bass of all I felt treble is high in these Sennheisers  ton of bass and when used proper eartips its just a treat for bass lovers WINNER  sennheisers cx180 SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL  boAt  I noticed in early few months quality over call was great but started to deplete after 56 months But its still good not as good as new Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side JBL  its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now Sennheisers  their NO microphone lol PNOTE boAt  JBL boths mics works with android and iOS perfectly WINNER  boAt 225 CUSTOMER CARE  boAt  1 Year warranty Had no issues till date so didnt got chance to check it But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences JBL  1 Year warranty Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center Sennheisers  2 Years warranty I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service centerNOTE I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service I would suggest this to all WINNER  sennheiser cx180 CONNECTIVITY All the earphones have 35mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devicesVERDICT I dont think I need to explain anything else now since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones To sum up I would say boAt 225 are good if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting then go for JBL CS100SI But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180Hope this review helps you make sound

SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS SMART WATCHNice qualityDisplay is awsomeSleep tracking,Original 3rd Jan 2021 This is my first smartwatch I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family but this is my personal first I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and Im aware of most of the products in the budget range While I can afford a slightly more expensive one GTS2GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro Oppo Watch Fitbit etc with calling feature I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa yet to be included but must be available through an OTA update Id have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro It still isnt released in IndiaComing to the watchs performance the typical features I tried today first day are Heart RATE HR SPO2 Stress monitoring and GPS I have a pulse oximeter from Dr Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2 The numbers on the watch arent very accurate to my surprise heart rate variation by 510 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10 points at times  But I still feel its more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house It wont surprise me if I dont get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone Music controls worked fine bluetooth data transfer or sync was good I couldnt control the phone camera as I couldnt get that feature to work refer to image and help me if you can I didnt face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications The readability on the watch screen has been really good Tried a couple of workouts While the step count seems to be fine not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modesTo conclude I wouldnt say that this watch is a disappointment but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats Probably I should give it more time but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy at least the Honor bands Ive seen Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as Im curious what all it can doI would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days Lets seeUpdate 8th Jan 2021 The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out Im hardly getting it for 35 days with always on display and an occasional workout Limited watch faces both on device 4 and the app 57 Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display Waterproof nature of the device is good I didnt dip it in water but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action I got the camera shutter to work I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa Notifications didnt have an issue but could not clear individual items clear all workedREVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS 2 Mini Smart watch 2021 modelHello everyone  Since the new model of amazfit GTS2 mini arrived  i am going to review the old model of itProsDisplay  155 inch amoled display  really good look   prosBattery  coming with 220 maH  from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer  normal use   But If you are a light user it can last it for 14 days  ProIP rating IP 68 water resistant which is cool ProHeartbeat sensor  It has heartbeat sensor and it is real  but it may not show real accuracy at all the time  But it performs good proComfortness  It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material proWork out modes  There are nearly 70 workout modes and i tested out some  since it is built in GPS  it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well procan track stressHas PAI feature to progress your workout with better experienceAlexa assistant  but need phone connection to activate this Has other modes like breathing menstrual cycle trackingtodolist  inbuilt alarm pomodoro timer sleep tracker Timer  In built compass  camera remote find the phone  controlling music etcNotification system  you can get notifications Call control system  You can accept or reject calls  but you cannot able to talk through watchConsBuild quality it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium  and half is poly carbonate con Watch faces  the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good  conSPO2  I dont know how much accurate it is  but coming to technical part  the sensors are failing most of the times  Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history conVerdict It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality The incoming call notification disconnects if youre away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch I have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors even though its not Damaged Water resistance is good I used to wash dishes wearing it No use of Alexai think its a good buy after 2 months of usageall over Amazfit GTS2 Mini New Version is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback apart for this other things are really niceSleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watchRather all thing are fantastic and battery life is 7 day in normal

TVGood productIts really worth the money butBetter product in this budgetProduct reviewnice tvBest productBudget friendly TV,This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV I got it in the offer and it was totally worth itPros1 Sound is awesome  100 satisfied with the quality of sound Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV2 Size and slim  It is slim and looks stylish Very light weight and handy to install3 Easy to install and mount to wall4 Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home5 It gets integrated with mobile apps remote WiFi networks very quickly and easily6 The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic7 It supports all the smart features like Netflix Prime and YouTube It is easily installable and signin to start using quickly8 It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing themCons1 Picture quality is 776p Its average and not very clear But it is worth the price range Ill not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified2 Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up againRest all is very good and loved this product I feel it was worth ordering If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and dont have extensive smart use then 100 go for thisIf you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but its very good for daily family shows and TV channelsOne last thing I want to express and Im ver disappointed about is thisI got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning and even today nobody turned up I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still nobody turned upThis is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon Im very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing thisWhat do you guys expect us to do Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when its been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days Even when Im having my smart TV delivered to my home I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properlyAt least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues Highly disappointed with this behavior and serviceGood productConnectivity is fasterBut performance is little bit slowerThe biggest problem I face is it dont have a aux cable so Im not able to connect my sound barthe HDMI port is useless it wont work soi connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it wont connect automatically everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually its a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now its been 4 months and its super laggy even after the update its just the sameyeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstandingthats allGood quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice Budget friendly Im happy with this After a few days the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentencethank you amazon and oneplus1 Sound is good2 Easy installation3 very Slim and less weight4 Voice recognition is goodLikeBudgetfriendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poorMany times gets disconnectedColor depth not that

phoneAn all Rounder in the  30k segmentAll good battery life could be betterA good Phone with few disadvantagesValue for Money product,Posting This After 8 Days of Continous UsageI came from Oneplus 5t that too because last to last week I had an accident and my 5t has dead on the spotAfter watching a lot of reviews on Youtube and Amazon I thought I should give it a chanceFirst Impression As you all know OP 5t has small display so its hard for first 34 days to useTyping because of big display A little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last 5t Solid built but it if its metal build then it will be more beautiful Space fusion color is looking killer Flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved Display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps ie chrome brave linkdin etc youll notice a color change from Black to Greyish color that gives a cheap feel and I dont know if its a software or hardware issueActual Review While gaming Call of dutymobile has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notificationcalls even after mute notification ONN everything is coming on screen and its very frustrating and annoying Battlefield mobile ground Asphalt 9 Clash of Clans Battle Royale are working flowless Some apps like Flipkart and Airtel gives some error screen zoom automatically while opening might be because of android 12 or something else Now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when I dont want that I dont want to set them everyday before using my phone ie I am using Bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background runWhile listing to music I want paranomic 360 sound but it reset to default automatically Gesture are not working fine this can be fixed with future updates I admit that funtouch OS has some more customization then Oxygen OS but it is missing some basic customization feature like I cannot change accent color shape size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because Oneplus oxygen OS is in my eyes but I am not overcome from oxygen OS Oxygen Os is lub Funtouch OS is very uncomfortable for me for the first 45 days but now Im getting it a little Less feature in gaming mode in comparison to Iqoo 7Camera Average as of now takes good picture in nightevening time and selfie camera is awsome OIS works good as per the budget and gives value for money Day time picture are good but something it changes the saturationcolor by itself automatically No heat observed while gamingdoing heavy task minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is 40c outside so this is not a big deal for me Screen recorder and mic works awsome Crisp clear display except the issue I told above 67 SOT in one charge 0100 4244 minutes charging time 0100 No bugs lags observed till date 120Hz refresh rate made it monster Some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use Adb commande to remove permanently A few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen virus scan comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow I stopped that Speaker volume is sufficient enoug loud in a roomConclusionIn 31k its worth for money with Snapdragon 888 processor and intelligent chipOnly thing that I dont like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experinceHas some bugs as of now ie In gaming mode in a few apps camera Display that might fixed with future updatesOverall worth for money And Yes you can pick it over Oneplus 9RT like I said youll probably feel bad for a week with its Funtoch Os but youll be okay with it after sometimeJust because of oxygen os spending 810k is not a great idea I thinkCamera quality is good  Video stability is awesome processing and other functions are nice   UI is not that good and battery life is not upto the markPros Super fast app experience due to Snapdragon 888 Super fast charging good display but not comparable with Super Amoled of Samsung other phone Good large display size No heating in general use Only seen when using camera video call but it cools down fast Accessories given with the phone like Fast charger USB c to 35 female adater thin screen guard and translucent back cover Ok cameraCons Display is not super amoled or vivid like Samsung A or S Series phone Battery drains fast Avg front camera Earth current can be felt when touching back camera while chargingI was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD 888 has its own share of heating issues and all but for 28k this is one of the best phones in the segmentI had Pixel 6A and Nothing phone 1 as other options Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects the performance the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredibleAlso Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so its a plus pointThe only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to 60Hz It starts to act as it lowers to 3040 fps or something And the battery life is average Its 1 charge in the evening for sure But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enoughI use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style Recommended to allGood display good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass smooth experience camera good but front video could be given 60 fps good haptic every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better Overall satisfied with the productThey are ok i can rate 255Mobile is worth its moneyIdont use fingerprint and camera are very good battery life

kettle with warmer  temp control half coil heating element looks oddOverall a Good Electric KettleOverall goodGood Multicooker within budgetAgaro esteem Multi kettleQualityVery nice product Like itNice one for hostellers A must buy product,1 I have used it mainly for boiling water knob turned maximum to right so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings2 It takes about 10 min for water to boil3 Suggest Mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc as I see some other kettles   It may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room4 The stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but its ok for the price  There may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a C shape due to the C shaped half coil at base funny design maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle  The scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe  They seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing5 Given wide based cylinder shape it is very easy to cleanTo be aware The kettle does not autoshut off when water boils  Similarly the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off  Else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating I havent tested this though  These are mentioned in the manual  So this can be thought of as a warmer  boiler  So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil  I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that mannerAccessories Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided  Given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated I would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way eg steaming  A steel rack is given too  That could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itselfFinal verdict If you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price this will do the job  If a similar product was available with higher wattage at a higher price I would have bought that insteadI wanted to give 1 star rating because Agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty It is a bad practice You cannot force customer to give rating As I mentioned it may result in the product having negative rating on Amazon despite being a good productIn my opinion the product itself is good It heats water very fast It is good for making Maggie pasta and boiling eggs But need to be careful while making Maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottomThe kettle is very easy to cleanThe cord length should have been longerOne issue that I noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heatEverything is good  it has been very useful for me There is only one drawback I guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever I boil milk or make teacoffee a portion of one side bunrs the milk Even while boiling water I can see the similar symptomAgaro Multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking boiling options like Milk Tea Eggs Maggi etcOnly negative point is that Agaro team promises extended warranty of 6 months by giving asking to give a positive review on Amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warrantyDelivery has safe got item safelyDelivery on time instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel studentsHope for warranty and company responseI liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something it sticks theirOverall gorgeous product The most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big That is a better option for your kitchen and aslo that is the best option for hostel usersLiked the design and operation However cord length could be longer Temperature control is good but knob need some modifications

this read to find out Good oneGoodBest productStopped working in just 18days and worst after sale servicePerfectPrice seems to be highSolid one better and best one,Seller Cloudtail India Private LimitedPrice 2200 Price can drop as low as 1700Delivery One day Prime BangalorePackage Big carton box with air pack No damageRecommended YesReturnable YESRoom Heaters which one do you needBefore my review I will let you know which one should you buy An oil heater is best that you can buy but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than 3 months and well below 10 deg For normal winter uses I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat Please avoid conduction based ones They can consume less power cheap but they are very slow plus burns oxygen Also note whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat settingProduct ReviewThis product from USHA is a convection type room heater and I have listed the below features and information Twin Blade fan Thermostat builtin Like AC will turn onoff as per temp changes 1000W2000W operation 2000W means faster heating Fan only mode for normal table fan type Cant adjust speed ONOFF Power LED when it operates Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm 15A Power plug and 1m cord length Retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches 1 year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat No Swing option very directional You must position it correctly and securely The Thermostat option is good to have and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat as this will help reduce your EB bills as well as give comfortable weather inside The thermostat is not very accurate like in Air conditioners but works The user manual gives clear information about using itHow to set up Power on select 1000w2000w The switch is not easy to operate Set to thermostat switch to MAX Anticlockwise Let the heater run till you feel comfortable Warm inside Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning Note if you have mistakenly set it wrongly turnoff and turnon Once again follow the same step aboveI use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size In Bangalore it is about 2021 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks and it took about 2030 minutes to bring it 2627 deg with 1000w in almost closed room Please note if your place has a room temperature Not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature In such cases only use 2000 W setting It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help But you must keep your window slightly open never use it on a closed room5A or 15AI see this as a main problem as in many of our houses we only have 15A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable This unit can only be plugged into 15A socket The reason is when you operate a 230v unit with 5A socket you can only draw a maximum of 1150 Watts 230v x 5A from that socket However since this unit operates also at 2000W it requires 15A as that could only provide up to 3000W 230v x 15A like ACs etc However you can safely use this unit from a normal 5A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT 1000W ALWAYS Just buy a 5A to 15A converter socket and use this Do not worry it will work just fine but never use 2000W though If you house has MCB Tripper then its much safeTips Always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit First try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater Using after a long storage  Keep a window slightly open for fresh air Air can feel dry after sometime can cause nose irritation and dryness Room must be ventilated adding water tray can helpDrawbacks1 Fan noise sometimes unbearable in a calm room2 Average Build quality and finishingFinal wordsI recommend this product a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen but makes dry air which can easily be overcome The prices could drop around 1700 sometimes so please check price before buying Thanks for reading this if you have any doubts comment belowOn first Day  I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues I am happy on this product GoodhttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesI61GxDSyEyLSY88jpgHiI purchased this Usha 812T heater which got delivered to me on 29th Dec 21 We use it moderately for just 34 hrs in dayIt was working fine for 18 days Howeveron 19th day ie on 16Jan22 night after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khadkhadkhad sound and all its coil were red hot Since we were awake I just switched off the power from main switch It could have resulted into burning or fire if I would have delayed for few more secondsWhen I picked up the heater in hand it looked some part was loosened insideThen on the next day on 17th Jan 22 I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs However no one came in 48 hrs So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on 19th After that technician visited me Upon checking he found that out of 2 fans one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heatedI was relaxed that its not a big problem and would be fixed quickly But to my surprise the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed is not able to hold the screw tightly There was a problem with the coupler What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymoreAdding to my surprise the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available But he didnt came back When I called next day he said part is not available and has informed the company but cant say when it will be availableSo I called Usha customer care again and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asapSince then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each otherUsha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced I asked them how many days it may take as I cant keep on waiting for a month they just said they cant say when it would be availableSince it is too cold nowadays and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heaterIf they will replace it after a month winter would have already passed by thenThis is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha and it was not expected from Usha If they dont have the basic parts available with the service center what is the use of sending technician empty handedFrom now on I will never recommend Usha to anyone and if any Usha representative is reading this post I request to them to service my heater asapThanksGo ahead The cord is very short and required 16 amp plug point It eats up available oxygen in closed roomUsing since one year  found fit for house use,Ausente,Ausente,BAIXA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BAIXA

loving itExcellent productVery niceCompact way to make coffeeGood one for a Black coffee loverExcellent purchaseGreat ProductPerfect French Press I have got two of em,I gifted it to my mother last month it was like love at first sip easy to use easy to clean easy to flex a blessing for any Indian adult Still new to french press coffee so I used South Indian filter coffee for the past few weeks and could instantly feel the difference between a cup of freshly pressed coffee and one of instant coffee although I have been advised to try grinding my own beans for optimum enjoyment I seep my grounds for around 34 minutes after heating the press for around a minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heatresistant the glass is I would however still advise taking precautions The markings inside also provide a great measurement of how many cups I would end up making Not only have i used it for making coffee but also to froth milk and to make tea Attaching photos of a coffee i made using this french press with a layer of frothed milk Ngl one of the favorite purchases my family made am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyoneTime saving coffeefilterBeen using this for many months now and its great Love that it has line measurements Only thing is I wish the top surface had an arrowtype bump on the plastic to point where the holes are you so you dont have to look down but you can just tell by touchDelivery Amazon delivery is always reliable and it didnt fail me this time tooPackaging Both outer packing and the product packaging were intact Product packing had the right information and was very usefulProduct Very compact We used several coffee makers in the market but all required electricity to run We wanted to have a non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements Just add the coffee powder and hot water After a while when we press the central pipe coffee comes out The nozzle makes it convenient to pour it a cupFor this price in great India sale I think its worth I am inclined to give 5 star but reserving 1 star now Will use it for a month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies meGood one for a Black coffee loverVery very happy with Cafe JEIs French Press It has become an important part of my daily ritual now in past 10 days Easy to use and maintain and would recommend buying without hesitationInstruction manual could have been a hard copytoo much steps to get the ebookGot this French Press last year and another one few days back One for Coffee  another for Green  Black TeaTotally value for money The built is solid and filtration is on pointSuper happy,Ausente,Ausente,ALTA,RUIM,BOM,RUIM,RUIM,BAIXA

another to replace the phoneHonest opinionWorth the money but not as good as promisedGood budget model phonevalue for moneyGalaxy m53Good buy for 22kA little overpriced but gets the work done,Below is the experience so far1 Received a defective product Battery was getting drained out in few hours wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble  including Google maps Location was not getting captured2 Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open tried on 7th night as well but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile  Amazon app was in this phone Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile3 Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement4 Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely  couldnt identify the issue5 Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6 First visit to center they did a software update 3 week old phone now  not sure what update would be pending and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone7 Faced issues the very same evening lived with it for one more day and went back next morning8 Second visit they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced9 I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesnt allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery which was defective11 They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they dont have the authority for that10 Called customer care number again and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the sellerSo back to step 3 Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end  If I manage to reach thereUpdate 11 All customer care said they cant replace the phone So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced Again whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again12 I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist battery was draining out by the minute I showed it to them They told me its a new battery and will take some time to stabilize They also asked me to buy a super fast charger while i bought from them to not take chances They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm Used for 2 days Same situation No improvement13 Went back to them again They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now14 Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true15 By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests15 They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed16 Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience17 I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund They refused with all their might and said phone is working now During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days I officially registered a complaint But still no luck of returning the phoneUpdate on Nov 30th18 I was traveling and outside the country On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70 charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980s Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times No luck Still grid lines My flight bookings hotel bookings and everything one can think of was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip19 Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center Nov 30th Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center They mentioned patch issue Software update dint happen  At this point I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation No 3 month old phones screen will stop responding because of software update missing They are opening the phone again to operate it after again refusing my request for money refundIts really good smartphone in its range packed with features And brand like Samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point I still give it a 37 stars as battery  could be better It also looses a point for not including a chargerPhone looks are good The charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger 25W original Also camera quality is not even like 32 MP total lied about 108 MP Samsung UI is not very friendly and easy Other brands have better and smoother UIPhone is very sleek bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is Good budget model phoneyou can not deny brand sumsung is a brand overall good product for long useGood worckCharger should have been part of it But product looks goodPricewise a little overpricedSome of the cons are a little rigid fingerprint sensor after 2 months of use i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone battery life not up to the mark struggles to go the entire day even with regular use no 35 mm jack and a buggy BTPros a very good

moneyNothing earth shaking about this productIt is goodGreat productThe product is working nicely and worth buying productWriting after 15 years pros cons solution and trics do read my reviews and voteWorks but no use,Here is a try at a review of this product after using it for an year nowUse Case I am a NCR resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst I have it installed in the bedroom about 300 sq ft so well within the advertised max room space While using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution additionBuild Quality The purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing It has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet The arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front This helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required The top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular LED screen The 4 buttons are  Power Night Mode Fan Speed and Child LockSetup The air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately Thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use The setup is pretty straightforward The main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space The installation order of the filter is as followsFirst  HEPA Filter The same has indication on top to correct installation You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerSecond  Active Carbon Filter The same has indication on top to correct installation You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerThird  Pre Filter This one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust  impurities so that it does not clog the other main filtersThus the filtering order is Pre Filter  Carbon Filter  HEPA filterWorking The air purifier can be set to different modes One of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor The pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular LED screen by means of circular rings of different colors  Blue Min Violet Pink Red Max Red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automaticallyIf you are not a fan of the automatic mode you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speedmodes They areFan Speed 1  Indicated by 1 on the screenFan Speed 2  Indicated by 2 on the screenFan Speed 3  Indicated by 3 on the ScreenAutomatic Mode  Indicated by A on the ScreenAllergen Mode  This can be only added on top of Automatic Mode It essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels This is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rateTurbo Mode  Indicated by T on the Screen This puts the fan in the maximum speed possibleThats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier Additionally the filter has an automaticforced night mode The purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode The same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier What this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noiseSummary So as to summarize my review and add my view here the filter works pretty well for the use case i have On regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from Red levels to Blue Switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels On drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control If not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levelsThe air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product Much that is missing in similar priced competitorsI am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise I believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible By reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse when i dont want to use turbo mode just yetDurability of the filters has been decent I have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the HEPA or the Carbon Filter On yes that reminds me the Air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen It even does that for the prefilter which does not have to be replaced but just cleanedwashed That i have received 34 times this past yearOverall i still strongly recommend this product Good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launchedGood productThe product does not stand out notably but it probably does the work it is supposed to It is too late now to return this product and try another makeOver all good productbEasy to installWell designed product Yet to experience filter replacement and consequently the recurring costThe product is working nicely and worth buying productWriting after almost 15 years all pros n cons Everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 68 months it become totally black few advice1 Dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked2 If you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners3 Seal your doors most dirt  mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them4 Run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was5 You can clean pre filter only dont clean carbon and hepa filter6 Being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 45 times keep it under sun light for 45 hours7 Sometimes u get error of FO clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8

priceThere is a threebutton inline remote with mic located right below the right earpiece which can be used to answer calls control music playback and trigger the voice assistant on your smartphone The buttons themselves are quite mushy and difficult to distinguish between by touch aloneXiaomi Mi Earphones performanceXiaomi claim that the Mi Earphones feature a 3rd generation balanced damping system that creates a transparent sound and metal sound chambers created via a 20step process Marketing fluff aside how do the earphones really sound Simply put surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for twoWhile most earphones in this price range have overinflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range the bass response on the Mi Earphones is controlled and restrained It doesnt overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs That said bassheads will be left slightly wantingIts surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix although they do get overpowering sometimes The mids are slightly repressed which is evident in vocalheavy genres such as blues While the clarity on offer is decent for the price songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy This is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bassThis earphone set is fantastic And highly deserving of money I used it for a while last in 2022 and now Im buying it once more in 2023 In my perspective the Mi headset has good music and is easy to usegood goodNice productGentle bassNo loud soundProduct quality is decentDont expect heavy music experienceIts sometime uncomfortable but its fine i can adjustSeriously if you are a bass lover then you can go for itBut its built quality is not good it will damage automatically after 34 monthsit is not suitable for rough usesGot it for less than 300rs Not disappointted at allIf you compare it with other brands like Boat the sound quality isnt as good as the contemporaries But for the price I paid Im not disappointed at allThe bass is solid Noise cancellation is average and the earphones are a little

NeededEverything thing good except the installation experienceOverall taking all aspects TV is good within the price pointTv installation servicesOne among the good TVs in the marketPicture,I am posting this after a few weeks of using the productUsage Continuous OTT only no CableDish operatorAverage daily usage 68 hoursThe TV is a great valueformoney productInstallation The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth timely and hasslefreePicture The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony LG and Samsung with these kind of specs Movies and especially hires TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times the output while in hires  wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony Samsung LG etc however with time you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better TVSound Sound output is decent You wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as suchRemote Sleek sensitive and userfriendly Its exactly like Amazons remoteOS Same as any smart Android TV Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances it looks just fineStandalone and as your first smart TV  you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hires from the beginning It is a great value for money product without a doubtHowever if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past you will have a hard time adjusting with itPicture quality is good for this price didnt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps Only negative will be audio definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher Overall worth for money u spend But the installation process is just awful Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals  just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through onlineScreen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user actionReason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screenIf you buy TV in a small town shop it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours When you want to buy a TV from Amazon you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable The problem is with the installation they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product Its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat So I ordered my TV on Monday it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns If we had the technician details we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours beforeRegarding product its good quality and very good for a average user Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging I guessThis TV gives good results within the budget should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part1 The installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose So strictly be aware of this point2 The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time3 Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller tooFinal verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you ThankyouTeamAlso to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing NO need to other subvendor to getting installation and demo Also dependency on thirdparty involvement should be lessBad experience with TV installation stuffPls look into this Picture quality good Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect Remote not upto the mark4  for picture quality 3 for both sound and remote qualityGood quality picture but it hangs on home

expectedGoodPerfect Juicer  Very User Friendly in usageUser friendly and convenient to use for fresh juiceExcellent Little Juicer Fast and Easy to Clean Produces Very Good Quality JuicePremium juicerGood howeverMost effective and convinient juicer i Ever had,First of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this Philips HR1832 i made carrotapple Orange promoganateetc All i did and had fantastic juice Fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash thanks for this instant juice blenderGood dealI find this Juicer amazing endtoend it takes me around 1015mins to extract the juice clean  pack it back That easy it is to UseThe product is very good and user friendly Exactly as demonstrated in videoI used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice I wanted and I couldnt afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so I was excited to be able to start using this new one First off this is a nice compact design It really doesnt take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surfaceThe juicer is simple to take apart and put together instructions are not really needed though there are some basic pictures provided on the boxThe juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small I need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldnt need it to be much bigger to get them in So far my juicing attempts have all been successful  apples raspberries grapes cucumbers carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice I also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesnt work with  it seemed to work fine for me I can see how a banana or avocado might not work but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment The pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and I found I could easily squeeze liquid out but its in no way dripping and I would say a decent job had been done I know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldnt want in the pulp That way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with itJuicers produce different quality juices There are really 2 key areas to judge a juicer on its juice quality1 Some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item You can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted2 Some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice  2 signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients A faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth which is why the masticating style juicer slower chewing action creates better quality juiceIn terms of these 2 key areas this Philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice The slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers  To get more descriptive  I like to run the pulp of the Philips through the juicer 1 time to get extra juice out of it Running it a 2nd time and I get hardly any juice One extra run of the pulp is sufficientThe specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under 1 minute I think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off All the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater This has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff That said I have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly It certainly does not take much elbow grease and I found it very easy to clean off  unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used itI think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user Yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits The anti drip spout is not quite antidrip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as I have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place For the current price I would say it is well worth itHigh quality premium juicer with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max 80 to 90 juice out of fruits and veggies The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are availableI have been using this for a month nowIt is easy to use and clean and assembleBut at times I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grindingI feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice cause if i cut like a sliceflat one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulpTry to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 12 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and  it takes 1520 minutes to cut grind and cleanvery easy to use and very easy to assembleThanksPerfect home juicer  easy to clean assemble and comparable i loves it,Ausente,Ausente,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,BAIXA

and video qualityGood ProductWorth for moneyNiceGood,Update after 9 months of use1 The TV is still going strong  all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TVIts as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers After recent firmware updates the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared1 We can now arrange and move apps YouTube Netflix as per our wish on the home screen itself I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler2 There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier3 Prime Video still shows errors sometimes Though I think thats an issue with the app and not the TVStrongly recommend this TVOriginal ReviewI took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it However after using it for 2 months the following are my observationsGood1 The picture quality is fantastic There is no lag while watchingforwarding 4k8k videos2 I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models  The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now up to 40 works for me For my toddler to watch rhymes I set brightness to 0 and even then it is more than needed3 There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar I disagree  I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall4 Voice command  it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15  20 feet away5 Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature  no need to look for remote Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot It would be even better if everything on phone not just pictures and videos could be cast using the appNot so good1 If the TV goes to sleepscreensaver for more than 10 minutesa it often gets disconnected from wifi  have to restart it againb prime video fails to resume  displays error  and have to restart the TV againc On the home screen you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first  easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itselfOnly Cons till now got fast moving object looks blurr which was known before buying by other user review but i got this tv in 32 kAo over all satishfiedOnly minus that too critical is the installation service providerThe product is to installed by v care installation services providerThe installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properlyActual date of installation was on 210222 but was only done by the service provider on 271022The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and dont know how to behave to the customerHe behaved very rudelyThe installation service provider is a total damage and waste Not at all worthAwesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tvDolby atom 4

Durable Powerbank in 1k range  ReviewThis is the second power bank from Ambrane India i am happyIts heavy but goodGood productGood power bankThe power is bulkier,I bought this powerbank to use during my vacation with family It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging The speed of charging is alright and appropriate The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the PowerBank itself without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buyBit heavy but does its job Takes tooooooo much time to charge Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank chargingI needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try as i already have Honor  MI power banks 10000mAh ones Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones iit did live up to my expectations for the 1k range INSIDE BOX Powerbank

device5 It comes with a carry pouch more below on this part6 Compact form factor  sturdy design with ABS body CONS1 It does not autostart charging when the device is connected2 Since it has a touch button instead of pushbutton it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling3 There is a lot of conversion loss  backup is slightly less for a 20000mAh power bank Cons are significant enough to reduce 1 star There is scope for improvement points 1  2 in this product in the same range So  device LED STATUS 1st2nd3rd4th LED blinking while charging power bank Status of

LED solid glow Battery fully charged AMBRANE BOX DEBATE1 When i first received this power bank it came in a small box approx 12x9x3cm Mfg Aug 2019 with everything forced in congested space The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal  no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch2 When replacement came it came in a polywrapped bigger box 22x10x4 cm Mfg Oct 2019 with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening Looked like it was applied with an open box So its presence was useless This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch CARRY POUCH As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit Neither loose nor tight Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon VERDICT At the price point its not a bad deal Its a midway path bw low quality and highquality ones You can very well go for Ambrane as it makes good quality  durable power banks Rest nothing is perfect in this world For this thing only 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1year warranty from Ambrame is available If one can extend the budget by a few hundred MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body  better quality overall I have MI Honor  Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be from low to high Ambrane  Honor  MII am putting up this review after 1 day of usage This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family Before to this i have bought their PP30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison My dad uses Redmi note 7 my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you dont need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP30 Solid and sturdy built 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries this i came to know while buying this product  200 cheaper price than MI Touch button at the top to know the power status this is something unique  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13 to 100 at 2 cell battery indicator which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro I dont know either it is pro or con both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 30 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 24 Amp but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dads Redmi note 7 which supports QC 40 either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 24 ampCons Very stuffy packaging it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box It has some adhesive tape at the top i dont know why  which when you remove it puts scratches on the top be careful while removing the same No torch light their PP30 have it only micro cable inside the boxDefinitely heavy but I knew this I will recommend this as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phonesNice productPower backup is good but the USB cable provided is very bad It stopped working after few months of usageEverything is good but the battery

SinhaSujayZ,R36UIGIQWYOKTRISUCL5YV9EZN,"4,1",2,22318,4,THE PERFECT PHONE  FOR MY REQUIREMENTSGalaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability,I would not consider buying an iphone simply because my friend owns two of them  or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations which may differ from mine I am an oldfashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres megapixels and megabytes  but I think of a cellphone as a utility item not a status symbol Applying a technocratic approach I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirementsMy foremost requirement  which is entirely nonnegotiable  is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts basic net connectivity a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage Besides I would like to use a new handset for at least two yearsApart from exigencies I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet videoconferencing or sending emails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activitiesI am equally clear about what I do not need I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies reading books listening to music or creating fancy social media posts Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera At the risk of sounding flippant I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf  primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golfHaving used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years I vastly prefer the former My last phone which gave me over 30 months of good service was a Samsung M30 Since that model is obsolete now I focused on its upgraded cousins M32 M33 and M52 The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33 I concluded that the latter offers better value for money Generally it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small With these considerations I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage Just twenty years ago I was using a desktop with 2GB memoryAs a confirmation for my choice I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 8GB RAM 128GB Storage which my son had recommended The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus productAs for body colour my first choice was Emerald Brown but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phoneDespite a strong family resemblance with my old one M30 the new phone M33 offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone but these differences are acceptable to me Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates which reduces the worries on these fronts Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks it is heavy its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings so long as the M33 meets my requirementsI was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers  because old chargers like old handsets add to ewaste However it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 wattsTo cut a long story short I ordered a 25watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time After using the new handset for a couple of weeks I find that my phone is at 6070 charge at the end of the day and it takes 3040 minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10watt charger except that it would have taken 6090 minutes for full chargingI conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone  but for my requirements A word of advice if you are planning to buy a new phone it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to useWith 5G connectivity a 120Hz display and solid performance the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsungs bestvalue smartphone yet under 20K segmentProsAlmost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 41 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love none of the flagship grade features are skipped here apart from dex mode and spen features Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading of apps makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like ascreen recordervideo call effects Game LauncherLink to WindowsDual MessengerQuick ShareMusic Share and Secure Folder along with many others Some of the fancy Android 12 features like the ability tochange the color paletteof icons and menus based on the wallpaper anddim the screen for easier reading in the dark are also includedVoice focus for calls is excellent feature phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areasI had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate signal stays strong even in rural areas thats a positive point with good accuracy4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlesslyWifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performs more than satisfactorily with low latency responseBluetooth 51 connectivity is strong and has good range no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 metersAudio quality via 35 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro much more defined and well roundedFor media consumption widewine L1 support is present Good AV experience on ott platforms I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at 1080p4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is availableMany cool camera features  boasts AR fun mode single Take Object Eraser and Video TNR Temporal Noise Reduction which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors Samsungs way of boosted colour processing some may like it some may notExcellent battery life got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage It takes around 15 hours to go from 0100 and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45 provided you have 25 watt Samsungs chargerDespite summer time phone has managed to stay relatively cool 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 30 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors making this device more value for money in long runConsUltrawide camera is on softer side  lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details  Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4kAmoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPreinstalled bloatwares like Moj dailyhunt sharechat byjus are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device but we can expect exynos 1280 to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design  Chunky in size carries some heft Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer which adds up to the value cost

lastAll good but miner bugs just dont upgrade it to 1306 New update details givengood tablet,first i would like to comment on the tab market of India the most peculiar thing I have seen in India is when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the USA you watch the prices of chromebooks tablets back to school offers in the US and compare them to India and it feels extremely unbalanced after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier 1 brands started delivering garbage for 20000 rupees snapdragon 400 old mediatek 4gb ram abysmal non ips screen for 20k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students THIS TABLET BRINGS THE REVOLUTIONI am no student but bought this for day to day use and I am an user of the normal big bezel 7th gen iPad so my review will be comparative in nature also i bought this at 23000 rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price I paid1 if you are planning to buy an iPad just buy it considering 64gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updatesthis tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad FOR 23K RUPEES even for 27k it is fine2 build is fine although I put a tempered glass on the 1st day itself back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy3 the IPS screen is really good there is no backlight bleeding no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background I am used to OLED screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but OLED is impossible at this price the screen is better than my 7th gen iPads display it is brighter has more punchy colours blacks are darker on top of that 120hz panel hdr certification dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet4 snapdragon 860 is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market hence I say if you dont want this just buy an iPad but dont buy any other android tablet at 2030k price point all are trash 860 was fine with all those games which rule the market today it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless5 i cant comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i dont see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming it has a 225 watt charger in the box although it does support 33 watt charging the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my iPad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers6 the camera is okayish just like most tablet cameras the iPad has even worse cameras for document  scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in 25k range tablets7 the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers they are loud have depth are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost 4050k they will hit you as a massive surprise i did not at all expect such good speakers they seriously outmatch those cheapo 700Rs boat goat mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes separation and low end of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantitycoming to the cons1 was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldnt find a place for a 35mm jack not even a dongle in the box they should seriously stop copying apples wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates although I mitigated the issue by using portable dongle DACs like shanling ua1 ibasso dc03etc which i generally use with even my phones and my PC coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some LG phones with quad dac i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not although it works with my old MI A2 dongle just fine2 for 23000 rupees I dont expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with 23k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as Indian tablet market and its offerings but for 27k they could just offer a bundle where you pay 1k2k rupees more and get the pen as an add on3 the accessory market might not be that vibrant already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at 5000 rupees LOL the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i dont trust those type of casesone more issue that I would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by 5001000 rupees within a month or two by doing the good old GST BRO so if it ever reaches 2829k for the 128gb version just close your eyes and buy an iPad with card discountsso in a nut shell for 23K it is was no brainer but even for 27K it is a really good deal considering what its competitors arehope this was helpfulI have been using the Mi Pad 5 for over a month now and am only glad that I didnt spend more on an iPad Once the retailtherapy phase of the device wears off what remains is the user experience While it is true for both devices I find that Im more at ease with the Mi pad 5 for the sheer look and feel of the content I watch in it I also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs PDFs and I often found myself amazed almost chuffed over how good the content looked That display gets the accolades for a reasonThe Mi Pad 5 largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the iPad a gross generalisation So heres my take on Apples iPad 9th Gen vs Xiaomi Pad 5If you have an Apple device already and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet you need to stick to the iPad Not just because it is going to regulate the standard but you will definitely miss out on the features that ecosystem offersSo buy the iPad if youare not concerned about the pricetagare looking at designing with the Apple pencil and are familiar with or going to use ProCreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soonintend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the Sidecar feature  if you dont use it despite buying the iPad you are missing outengage in a lot of official videoconferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame The iPad has a feature that addresses this to an extentare not expecting substantially higher results than the Mi Pad 5 from the inbuilt camera in generalhave a proclivity towards the Apple design their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices Apple makes for youdont really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the iPad is able to do and that this list is unlikely to change in the near futurelooking for a reliable product that will receive Software support for a long period of timeare expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch IDOn the other hand buy the Mi pad 5 if youare looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the Google PlayStore and perhaps not found elsewheredont care much about the stock iOS cookiecutter experience and think customization is the only way youll truly be happy with the tablet you usewant the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet  meaning better video calls and video capture This doesnt mean the camera will replace the phone you already have but the Pad 5 is a tool that goes the extramile of taking good quality images scanning documents and allows edits on its large screenvalue videoquality from the Mi Pad camera than the AI that drives the facetracking function iPad offerswant the most of the audio experience higher audio quality clarity and richnessare expecting rich colour depth HDR quality video experience and will be spending more than 50 of your time on the tablet watching videosdont like limitations imposed on you as with the software you use sideload APKs rooting Custom Firmware overclocking etc If you do any or all of these forget about the iPadare mostly going to use it as a fun device to watch movies on or consume audiovisual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and a leg comparatively to fix a broken screen or a damaged back panelare okay without a fingerprint scanner and is okay with FaceID PIN or Pattern for securityAt the end of the day you as a user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device not the logo at the backThe tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches I have contact to Xiaomi  they will try to fix it One req dont upgraded after you buy dont have to do 1306  After the update not a single Google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many Black patches around the bar white bar sometimes nice tablet you can go with it And if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word Excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and I am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for Android l because Android 12l is good for tabletNew update is hereSo the new Android 12 update is here unfortunately is not Android 12 l but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but its totally refined from the past and system is working great 120 hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than 10 hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily 2 to 3 days because I am doing PPT Excel sheet and other documentation its work totally fine and yeah thats the new update and go for xiaomi back 5 About pencilSo I bought xiaomi pencil for 6000 and if I say latency has been improved but if if you dont have the budget of 6000 go for another shopping site which name after f cart yeah and you can buy its fsmart buy pencil for 1500 rupees it works fine too and you dont have to spend 6000 you can go with the 1500 just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note downover all i am satisfied with this tablet,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31jUKdJdjHL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Snapdragon-Resolution-Refresh-27-81Cm-Display/dp/B09XXZXQC1/ref=sr_1_437?qid=1672903017&s=computers&sr=1-437,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,BAIXA

earphones you can find out there under 500 Bucks Are they Comfortable Lets find out Not so good Not so bad Good but i dont recommendSexyYou can expect it to work for a yearGood buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 67 monthsVocals are good music is bit dizzy and there is a sound zzzzzzzzzz when everything is silent Superb,Technical SpecificationsHeres the technical information of Boat BassHeads 225 InEar Headphones The information provided below is as per the manufacturer Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz It Features 10 mm drivers Rated Impedance of 16 ohms Comes with 12 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable 35 mm GoldPlated LShaped Audio Jack 90 degrees Sensitivity  98 dB3 dBBuilt Quality  DesignI was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal It has a diagonal gridlike texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel  attractive appearance The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating it is a tanglefree cable  does its job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling Despite the metal construction Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight  comes with a microphone  LShaped 35 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal Overall the built quality is excellent for the price  seems very durable The ear buds have proper L  R labels and are clearly visible Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed outoftheboxAudio QualityTo ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit I used highquality MP3 files of 320 kbps  Lossless audio formats like FLAC  WAV For smartphone listening I used Poweramp music player  tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability For the computer I used iTunes player  VLC Audio player I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod iPhone  Sony MP3 Player All this went for more than 10 days  finally I had my resultsBoat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed they really are very bassy as compared to others During my tests with them I found that the audio quality is very good for the price the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals they were clearer than before but overall average The treble was again very good the highfrequency sounds were clear  pleasant to ears The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent When listening to music the overall sound quality is amazing you can easily distinguish between different instruments  sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphonesNoise Isolation  ComfortWhen it comes to Noise Isolation Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it They come with medium sized ear tip preinstalled which seemed perfect for my ears once the earphones are on I wasnt able to hear outside noise they sealed my ears completely  delivered an immersive experience Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation  comfort Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff  somewhat awkward when used for longer periods Since the housing is made up of metal you may find them popping out every now  then when used during running jogging or any other sport or physical activity this didnt happen as often for me but for a friend they keep popping out every now  then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks they were a bit uncomfortable initially but as I got used to them they were fine plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on themFlat Cable  MicrophoneThe cable is great I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free  comes with a rubberized coating The cable does its job well The microphone is again exceptionally good it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise During calls the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick upreject calls on the go without taking your phone out It can also be used to control music which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225Warranty  PriceBoat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe in case you need it for warrantyFinal ThoughtsIve personally used Boat BassHeads 225 InEar Headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and Im pretty much impressed with them Im personally a fan of Extra Bass IEMs and currently my primary IEM is Sony MDRXB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category Comparing Sony MDRXB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didnt disappoint me obviously it doesnt stand a chance in front of Sony MDRXB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225  the quality they offer I was really very impressedBoat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices  music players I can say that theyre amazing for the price a pure steal deal The bass output is amazing and is very intense Ill recommend using correct size ear tips  good quality music player like Poweramp Android for better bass output The treble is good  vocals are average somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results The mids are again averageMy Rating  4 out of 5The VerdictTaking everything into account overall Im very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225 The Built quality is amazing the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass  good overall soundstage Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals mids  highs Overall the vocal  highs are good  mids are average but still good for the price Ill recommend these IEMs to bass lovers  budgetconscious people who are looking for high quality  durable earphones at a reasonable price Genres like EDM Rock HipHop sound really great on them Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price rangeHOPE I HELPED YOUTHANKSYes so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500 Yes you can consider it to buy But there are few points to remember before buy From my user experience I can tell you this1 This is not comfortable at all It slips from ear mostly You feel pain in ear after using it2 Never buy this for ONLINE CLASS as it is not possible to wear it 68 hours straightly3 After switching from Boat Basshead 172 I feel that the bass is not good as the previous one I dont know why It should be better4 Sound dont explode or go outside of the buds to 50 as it go outside on Boat 510 headphone so its good5 Feeling heavier on ears Not as comfortable as Realme Buds 2 Though both are metal build For balance sound you can buy Realme Buds 26 Buy it only to listen music not for too long time Do not consider it for Online class and Long time wear session  Hope it helped you Its just my opinion from using Boat 225 Boat 172 Boat 510 Realme buds 2 Mi basicIts a very good product but i dont recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head they will fall off easily with the slightest motion you will soon find it annoying Sound quality build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate youRaat me apne Babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta hI purchased the product a year agoIt worked fineI love the sound qualitybut you may not expect it to work after a yearMy headphone doesnt work  now properly My warranty get expired so I have to buy a new oneGood buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 67 monthSound quality is above average  but I got 15 years old manufactured ear phones build quality is as per cost  cant expect much  there is buzzzzz sound when music is silentThe earphones sound is awesome,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/3101FmUqUOL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/boAt-BassHeads-225-Special-Headphones/dp/B01MF8MB65/ref=sr_1_191?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-191,BAIXA,BOM,BOM,RUIM,RUIM,ALTA

budget segmentBest value for money But afraid of future MIUI updatesDont purchase it as camera phone Dependable  its been a yearBudget mobileGood for basic usePhone is nice  but software is not,I was looking for a phone below 10K I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones My requirement was a phone that has good network reception good wifi reception a balanced software good battery life good screen that dont strain eyes a good hardware 35 mm headphone jack and a charger i dont need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data I dont watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD 2K 4K videos over mobile network For downloading documents social networks banking apps 4G is more than enoughIn my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM Realme Narzo 50 was 9999 during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11 But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749  6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away So this was the only option I knew then availableRedmi note 11 has AMOLED Display I am not bothered with 60Hz 90Hz120Hz I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you dont need that Display size is 643 inch it could have been better if it were 67 inch I prefer big display phone Redmi note 12 has that big display A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth The screen has a punch hole camera which looks goodThis phone duel speakers One is more powerful at bottom and another on top But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good What more do you expect from such tiny speakersThe phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor still I get good signal and never disconnected Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phoneThe phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point The battery gives long backup With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features like phone sms email FB WA etc But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag The experience is butter smooth However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I dont have to clear RAM manually However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared SD 680 doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage The cable is USB A to C and feels goodThis phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailableThis phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 22 storage The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life This has 2 Sim  SD card slot Which is a great Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregationThe phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones And I have no problem with plastic I dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap I am happy with plastic back The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month This is inherent chemistry of TPU and no one can prevent this chemical degradation How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlightThe fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly The touch screen is excellent tooHowever I dont like some of the preinstalled apps Some can be uninstalled a few cant especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store I dont like them However I like the pre installed security app There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good Does not show pictures like 8MP camera I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the userSo I give Redmi 11 a score of 9510 This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749 during Great Indian festival I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K k videos or shoot such things This is not or those who are crazy for 5G Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment50 days usage1 Good battery LIFE Bqest for dayday use 33W charger also good2 Best display but shouldve 120hz instead of 903 Sturdy inhand feel4 Stereo speaker is loud and crisp6535 split5 Camera above average But good concerning the price6 Buggy UIminor as expected But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 1257 4G chipset SD 680 which is fine 4G always available8 Some minor issue with WiFi reception Dont know may be they will fix it through OTA THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE  THERE CASUAL GAMER  BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWSMOVIES NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMINGNOT FOR PUBG COD LOVERSThe first look of this starbust design is eye catchyno word to express its designin hand feel and and its all physical dimension the second this which impress me its battery backupeven you playing game hardly for a long timeit gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W is also a good deal at this price The third impressive factor is its dual speakerI have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it Media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display very colour charming display literally the display quality is unbeatable The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point Fingerprint button is also very responsive All other things and features are good to the price pointOnly one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower gradeeven my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this had better camera than this So plz I request you to all  dont buy this for camerajust dont The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to meI dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phoneIf you are non camera user then you will surely go for itPros design inhand feel battery and charging amoled displaydual speakerCons cameraQuite a smooth daily driver phone The overall experience has been satisfactory cameras good durability also seems to be good Ive dropped it quite a few times  the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up 120hz feels great Charging speed is good too nothing mindblowing though Battery life is decent Lasts quite a bit but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time its a little less for me But I dont have any problem with battery life for nowIt does what the description saysCamera quality not upto the mark compared to other redmi mobiles Even A3 model clicks better picsFinger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint readVolume is good for both call and streamingFast charging but charger gets heated soonBattery back up is good unless you dont do heavy gaming and all day video sreamingDual app and dual space option is missingLight weight and good video resolutionOverall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography  gamingI bought this for my dad and its working good for him if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone userPhone is good but i facing weird bugs due to software issues After that i manually installed latest global software then working fineWhen i was using indian firmware after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec but after manual installation its working fine,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4121yWSVFmL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Starburst-Qualcomm%C2%AE-SnapdragonTM-Included/dp/B09QS9X9L8/ref=sr_1_199?qid=1672895806&s=electronics&sr=1-199,BAIXA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,ALTA

priceVery nice mic in this price rangeIn budgetProduct Good Packaging damagedGzzzbbbbb mic ,at Rs319 its a great deal I use it for mobile vloggingNoice cancellation is not workingValue of money Good mike worth moneyVery nice mic in this price rangeAfter seeing many microphone I found thisI bought it becuase of its good ratings and reviews and in a buget price This is best for beginnersThe first time I had ordered this mic I received in a amazon plastic bag and the product box inside was completely damaged and was sealed using cello tape Also the mic seller sent me was damaged and had low quality audio It was a duplicateBut when I replaced I received the packing in a cardboard box but still the inner box had a few damagesThe mix received inside was goodHere is a detailed review of the mic1 The quality Quality overall nice The wire might seem filthy and weak but in reality when I tested it it was indeed a bit durable It can easily sustain a bit of a pull and twist Just mind the spots when the wire meets the audio jack and the mic2 Sound quality Sound quality is really nice BUT BUT BUT before you think of buying it read the paragraph below of noise cancellation The mic catches sound equally even if you are from far away or close to it3 Noise Cancellation This is a major point I used to mic a lot for testing purposes Let me share my experience I tested it in different environmentsa In a closed room with AC and total silence In such environment you will get crisp sound like a boom microphone But you will also receive a bit of white noise or background static noise which you can easily reduce using the noise reduction featureb In a room with ceiling fan on and moderate noise Still seems good but not great Your vocals would still be crispy and clear but the background noise will increase Still if you use nice noise reduction software like Audacity it will sound great Adding background music to your video would helpc In a room with standing fan on and high noise Not recommended at all Not only this mic but any mic would capture a TON of noise To express statistically there will be atleast 40 noise of wind whooshing in the backgroundd The same high noise room with windows open You will die doing noise reduction Not gonna lie the background noise increases by 60 times  DONT TRY THISThe pop filter or the sponge on the top of the mic helps a lot When you are speaking close to the mic a lot of air goes in while speaking So when the filter is attached the output sound does not have air whooshing but with the filter removed the output sound is only airNow to sum upMic is overall good Noise cancellation is not great but yeah for the price range it is the bestRecording tips1 Record in a silent room with AC or else turn on the fan at the least speed so it doesnt make much noise2 Use the collar clip to place the mic dont hold it in hand  I mean this is common sense P 3 If transmission lines electricity wires which are above the head go from close to your room I would recommend changing roomsNow the reason for this is that sometimes the mic can catch electromagnetic intefrerence  This maono mic wont catch it but I recommend this for generic mics4 Do noise reduction in Audacity It is very effective than the inbuilt noise reduction tools in video editors Also it is very easyAlso BOYA BYM1 MIC SOUNDS ALMOST THE SAME AS THIS MIC There is only like 2 difference in noise cancellation But I would still give both of them 3 stars for noise cancellationTHATS ITHope you understand what I mean to sayPeace outNice

lookingQuality of materialNice productGoodOne of the Best Mouse for the priceGood holding good dpi easy to useValue for moneyNice mouse,Hi guys Bought this yesterday so havent used it much so an early review But the most detailed review so please read till the end Very important points are mentionedLooks are cute It looks really nice and elegant I am using it with a MacBook Air So far it seems there are no problems using it The scrolling is smooth connection does not drop and there is no lag Connection is instant There is no pairing required Its plug and play along with the dongle provided with itIt sits low on the table feels weighty but not in a wrong way The battery adds to its weight but I have used heavier mice before and this one feels just right It has good grip Nothing to complain about thatButtons are nice and clicks are satisfactory not too noisy they are just right Scroll wheel doesnt feel cheap at all though I believe it couldve been better quality Body is matt finish and doesnt leave fingerprints on it though if youre someone who eats and handles the mouse then itll show the oil prints and thats true with any peripherals The mouse doesnt feel cheap overall but it is definitely plasticky though not in the bad sense It is definitely not cheap looks wiseThere is an on off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery which is included when the mouse is not in use There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light So thats a good thing and a definite plus The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with itNow over to a major flaw The mouse connects only though its own usb dongle which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself inside the battery door which I found mighty impressive and not through the laptops bluetooth Now this means two things 1 You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario And worse still if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle then youre stuck and I dont think you get only the dongle youll have to check that with the seller and  then the mouse is left useless in that case 2 Now over to  the problem I am facing which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews I use a MacBook so it doesnt have USBC inputs which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector which is not cheap because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse but consider this point It is very important It will NOT connect over MacBooks Bluetooth Otherwise it works well with the MacBook The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast Youll have to get used to that thing It doesnt feel very natural as the trackpad on the MacBook feels because of that speed problem but otherwise the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesnt jump around at least with my mouse Also the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad and I feel it could have been made better But I guess at the cost you really cant complain too muchOverall I think a good buy but the compulsion of having to use it with its own dongle is a major drawback I feel If that doesnt bother you then nothing else should keep you from buying this product especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks which is what it cost meThe quality of power button is very low easily it can breakNice Product works as expected as of now no issuesGoodVery smooth works on almost every surface paper table cloth etcTheres a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons rightleft clicksIt will not bother most of you I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things SoPersonally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button resulting in no rattle sound Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons click click clickBattery life of Logitech is known to be very goodQuality good dpi good good accuracy on off switch available smooth good deal at reasonable pricegood product on which you can use for long timeThis is good mouse thanks to Amazon for providing this product at reasonable price Very sharp and correct working

3020 Male A to Female A Extension Cable  orStorite 2 Pack USB 30 Male A To Female A Extension CableI have my extension cable from the laptop USB port hanging from the tubelight and this increased my

SoundBuds Curves Jabra Elite Active 65t Tribit QuietPlus 72 Overears HeadphonesOnly the Anker has aptX connectionI purchased Anker SoundBuds AKA3263011 Curves and this set has aptX when connecting this headset the CSR Software recognized aptX Is there a difference in SBCaptX I cant really tell in audio quality but the connection IS more stable Also I have not discovered a way to switch between SBCaptX like Smartphones It automatically connects as aptXSOME HEADSETS may not work properlyMy Brandnew Tribit QuietPlus 72 Headphones DID NOT work well at all It kept running in Handsfree mono modeFor comparison it sounds like listening to AM Radio Station If you experience the same effectTHERE MAY BE A WAY TO FIX THISBefore connecting your BT deviceRight click the BT icon Click on Bluetooth SettingsClick AudioVideo Tab you will see SCMST content protection etc In the dialogue box Click the box to enable Connect to content protection enabled headset onlyNow hit Apply then Ok Right Click BT Icon in TaskbarAdd Bluetooth DeviceAudioVideo Device then Search for the BT DeviceNow when you connect give it about 10 seconds then once connected it should provide the Stereo mode under Speaker icon in Taskbar Once you disconnect depending on any other Headset you will have to go back to these settings and Disable Content Protected device For My ONEPLUS Bullets Wireless Z I have to disable or else they only connect in Mono modeA very short walkthrough for connecting headsetMake sure the BT Icon is turned on  Blue colorOn  WhiteOff in Windows TaskbarRight Click and will bring up table with headingsThe 1st is to turn onoff the BT Radio which is the TPlink BT dongle itself BT signal is radio transmissionThe 2nd heading is for turning onoff Discovery TransmitReceive onoffThe 3rd heading is Add Bluetooth Device when you highlight this it will bring up the table which showsPhone  Computer  AudioVideo device  PrinterImaging Device  and KeyboardMouse  ALLThe 4th heading is Show Bluetooth Devices devices that are Already ConnectedThe 5th heading is Bluetooth Settings only for TPlink Bluetooth Donglenot onboard bluetoothThe 6th and last heading that mine shows is  About this brings up the software provider and vers there is no Update option here we have to physically check the TPlink website for UB400I only use Audio Devices I dont have any other BT products so I am unable to test other than headsetsunder Add heading go to AudioVideo Device left click  brings up dialogue box to Select a device to connect with this Computer at the bottom right corner click Search make sure your headset is on and not connected to any other systemhome theatersmartphoneOnce the Device shows up you can sigle click on it then Next on bottom of page or you can double click Either will connect to the device Once it is Connected give about 10 to 15 seconds for Windows to recognize the Connection You will see what the options are in next description In the taskbar click the audio profile speaker icon Here there are 4 options that pop up for me Noteif you only see 2 or 3 then read the section above that says SOME HEADSETS may not work properly TV sound Laptop speakers Bluetooth Audio Renderer Stereo and Bluetooth Hands Free Audio MonoClick on Bluetooth Audio Renderer Stereo wait a few seconds for it to complyNow your headset should be connectedIn watching Youtube I do get some lag but with different headsets the lag increases or decreasesThe same with me using VLC or Windows Media Player Sometimes if I stop the video app and restart then it will be no lagI dont use ZOOMTeamsSkype so I cannot test how the mic setup would functionAny one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it This would be helpful to alot of peopleFIRST post So for a few months I was using it strictly thru Win10 utilizing Win10 drivers and bluetooth connection page thru SettingsSystem But a few times i tried to use with music streaming to Sony XB400 or Oneplus Buds Wireless Bass edition and there would be intermittant drops Also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my HP AMD A6 chipset laptop Also anytime I took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive So I assumed it was a throttling going on with my USB ports I have Sandisk Dual Drive WD Passport DVi to HDMI and Logitech dongle So one by one i disconnected everything and left the BT dongle and it was a little betterSo I checked the TP Link India site for any FAQ related When I searched in the DownloadsDrivers section there was software driver present  So I downloaded installed it and Win10 taskbar shows BT icon to use theBT Dongle The Driver software is by CSR Harmony Wireless Software Stack Version 21630Once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the BT icon in taskbar The BT icon sits in the system tray as before Audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono Also if your playing a video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo It works really well I purchased a long usb male to female cable and now i have a little bit more increase in connection distance I have not tried this for transfer of files If and when I find a need to do so I will updatefor now at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my BT audio gear instead of purchasing a more expensive unit to give my laptop BT capabilites and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives Oh and I also purchased a seperate QZ Powered USB hub for my drives So the only USB devices connected are the Dongle and the hub Now when I disconnect the BT dongle my drives stay connectedI hope this information is helpful I tried not to make it too long but it happened If any questions arise please drop me a line and I will respond with whatever help I can giveTP link products usually work wellwhile longevity with continuous use may vary but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous useI have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters routers range extenders etcNow I have tried this Bluetooth adapterProsMinuscule size you can keep attached to the device not noticeableBut not recommended to do soas its usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent rangeso if one is too skeptical might lead to security issues although the hacker will have to be in the same house probablyRange is decentworks good in the same roomthis kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity usually without barriersI use it to connect headphones to the PC and it works nicely for thatI earlier had a Bluetooth 20 adapter from enter and that worked well too except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increasedso some choppy audio did occur with todays high quality audios and that got managed with this Bluetooth 40 adapternice clean audioLastly it works nicely with Linuxi use debian based Ubuntuand its almost plug and playI did have blueman Bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter I had And when I plugged it ini didnt have to do anything elseSo unlike what the site says about only windows it definitely works with LinuxI cant say if the 50 version UB500 will work thoughWhile installing the driver in windows I noticed it was installing CSR stackAnd CSR original chip  there are many fake ones is known to work with Linuxso maybe thats why it worked wellComing to windows i have win7I had bluesoleil preinstalled and it worked with itDidnt have to install any driver separatelyBut there is a driver available in their site for xp7In win8 and above its supposed to be plug and playSo no issues thereNow the consA bit high price than rest of the companies probably can improve on thati bought it for 400Audio quality is good but somehow compared to my enter Bluetooth 20 stackThe audio was a bit mutedhad to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudnessbut even then i feel a slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio no idea if thats a software or hardware issueencodingdecoding issueIts not very noticeable specially of someone doesnt have anything to compare withLastly the windows driver is 400 MBgranted it has both 32 and 64 versionsbut each one is almost 200 MBThats way to big for a driver of these devicesNeither bluesoleilblueman cross 30MBSo I dont know what is being packaged in those driversAlso somehow the driver didnt have a clean install in my system something to do with incorrect loading of c libraryIt didnt matter as I already had another driver installedOverall a nifty little deviceI have no need for 50 Bluetooth as i dont have any device that requires itI just needed a 40 adapter to solve the bandwidth problemand that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpfulDoes the job well few consHence one star lessUsing it for 2 weeks Just plug it  install drivers and you are good to go  Seem less connection with ps5 controller Latency is very low around 1ms  So basically connection is even faster than wired connection 2ms   But when I simultaneously connect airpods gen 2 the sound output was very weak  it was muffled But it serves my main purpose with ps5 controller Apparently it seems like its the most relevant Bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that generally comes in a BT adapters Id say the only con is the installation part it took a while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub500 aside from this everything is fabulousVery easy to install connectivity is also good but sometimes while using Bluetooth earphones sound cracks also Bluetooth sharing is quite slow thats allOtherwise th product is very good1 Easy to install I mean just plug in 2 Connectivity is on all point but 12 time i feel fumble issues3 sound quality is all depends on your wireless speakerIf you are tight budget its okay then Otherwise if can spend 150 extra go for BT 50 version Much better in both range and

duty mixer grinder delivers what it promisesWorks fastIts not working good I had bought in 2020 and the motor is makingGood machine but cap locks can be much betterGood Great Mixer Grinder but not good for juicesPowerfull mixer grinderPowerful but Pricey,Bosch TrueMixx Pro Mixer Grinder 1000 WattMGM8842MIN BlackReviewI usually do not write reviews but I felt I had to write this one because when I was researching which mixer to buy I found really bad reviews that do not do justice to the product I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product I have been using it daily sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period I hope this will help othersMixer includes capacity 1 Mixer body1 Plastic blender jar 1500ml  fruit filter1 Wet grinding jar 1500 ml1 Dry grinding jar 1000 ml1 Chutney grinding jar 400 ml1 extra Pounding Blade1 SpatulaBuild and overall appearance1 The mixergrinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerfulI have used it to grind both dry  wet ingredients such asgaram masala idlidosa mix Chana dal paste Poppy seeds pastecoconut chutney dry rice and urad dal powder ginger garlic paste ice etcI regularly blend and make milk shakes lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient2 Does the job fast within few secondsminutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with3 Body is good looking sturdy well balanced and easy to wipe clean4 The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience5 Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake6 The jars also are easy to use and quite wellbuiltJars  Blades1 The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades2 Chutney jar blade is fixed3 An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect4 A spatula cum blade changer is provided5 The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic6 Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquidsmaterials while grindingblending7 Each lid has rubber gaskets This gives a completely leak proof experience while grindingblending These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach8 All Jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars9 In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided  this is the only thing I have not used hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment10 Blender can be used without the juicer sieve and works fine11 In wet blender a flowbreaker is providedSoundSound is high but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machineDos  DontI feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product1 Do not overload2 Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest3 When turning the speed knobs  dont turn all at once from 0 to max You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly staying at each speed for a few seconds Actually for most things  low to medium speed is enough The machine is really powerful4 When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up  not the machine so give a little rest in between5 For wet grinding  use cold water to grind  that way the jar will never heat up6 DO NOT grind hot ingredients Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting  that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground Bring food to room temp and then grind7 Wash the jar gasket jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact8 Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets9 In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it10 To remove fine particles when dry grinding dont use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar You can use your hand and a brush  used for this purpose only11 This is an expensive piece of equipment  In my house only I  my husband use it We do not allow  children or household helpcooks to use it This way the machine will not be misused12 If you mixer does not work   please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine Remove some of the ingredients and try again13 Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops  Although they appear quite well made I cannot say if they will break when droppedPros1 The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises2 It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience3 Easy to clean4 Grinds and blends everything5 Leakproof lids6 Takes very little time to grind7 The motor does not heat up even easily8 The overload protector works perfectlyCons1 Guarantee  Manual  The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon websiteThe Amazon payment is the guarantee There is no separate guarantee card provided I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card2 Delivery  The mixergrinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding This was a big minus for me3 A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided  one of my lid clasps was loose it is working fine at the moment but as a backup company should provide these4 As the jars are pretty large for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry  wet grinding rather than only wet5 The jars do have screws heads on the inner side  but this is not a big deal  and can be cleaned quite easilyReview after using for few monthsPros The lock feature is really good for hands free usage Grinds very fast Say half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than 4 minutes Juicer is good extraction is good for the juicy fruits Good design and takes less space in kitchenCons Noise is there for the power it grinds But anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which I read before my purchaseSteel jars get heated up quickly So I used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heatJust need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a littlewet grinding jarTips clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge So that jars wont loose its shine I bought this Bosch mixer on 2020 and the motor is not working I have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in itit worked only for 2 yearsit was only for household purpose i purchasedvery much disappointed with a brandShowed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside True to its name the Bosch Mixer Grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen However the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challengeNAThis is a very good product overall The dosaidli and other such batters come out excellent The motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needsThe only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer It works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus oranges watermelon etc But the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content the juicer fails at extracting anything The juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp There is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush themAll in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juicesI was a happy customer of Sujata for the past 10 years and Bosch was a a good optionGood design powerfull motor  worth for the price i bought 5500 in offer It has a powerful motor does grinding pretty fast Compact size Lid lock clip very useful Priced high Juicer function is not much useful,Ausente,Ausente,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,ALTA

this head phone this is good gaming Pubg free fire battle field 5 Gta vthird per shooting game playing my experience good  please check after buy  one time replace then i got this and remember offer time buy this product this product price up and down i buy big billion dayWith USB Connector This headphone is good but not good for Base MusicHeadphones are nice and a comfy Sound is decent and loud However as it doesnt have its own volume manager and only controls the systems volume I have to keep the PC volume to 1 and still have to reduce volumes individually on apps and browser SO somewhat of an inconvenience for me as I dont listen to things in loud volumesMic works fine however it s not exactly adjustable Solid core surrounded by a spring so you have to bend it but it slowly goes back to an extent and the movement is limitedCable is covered by very thick coating and seems durable however it is not free from interference If your phone is near the cable you will hear the interference in the headphonesThe light on the mic is static and does not indicate the mute status Can be turned off alongside with other RGB lights on the headphoneYou can hear some whine when some software is trying to access the mic and nothing is playing in the headphones1 71 is Just Awesome2 The Software Is Very Good3 comfort Is Just Excellent Not that Good noise cancelling4 I bought it for 1600 and in that price u cant get this type of product5 If u have 2k budget try to get boat im300 it will give better comfort and noise cancellationThe product is nice For the price it has good features It is a bit heavy tho The ears heat up easily and you can start sweating easilyThe product is as displayed and is really well built But the upper part is of metal which adds to it premiumness makes it heavy Someone who only uses AirPods or other TWS will find it difficult to adjust The wire is long and braided and the controller works great too No need for any external drivers to use the control in mobile devices as well Works absolutely fine with OTG without compromising noise cancellationOverall a great deal for 1299Early reviewLikedLooks are greatWire goodSound good bass good treble goodMic level is goodInterface acceptableCan hear sound going from left to right  when enemy runningWorks on my mobile with otg good sound makes me happyDislikedFake add that its 71 there was no demo either how it becomes 71 like there should be an audio file to demo 71 or some sort of test to prove so actually its just a more organized stereo headset But its OK for this price like many other I know Real 71 will be Dam expensive and cant be sure how human ear will respond to that technique At this stage I am still not convinced that is even possible in the headset anywayMicrophone isnt steady and irritates keeps on going below lip levelMust have Been detachable atleastplease dont search for light in mic as its not in the white model one gets  confused upon watching videosPeople complain earpain but they dont understand it isnt heavy or tight but the deep loud bass causes earpain which they dont adjustBuy itGreat sound Great Base Great quality I felt llil bit heavy but thats Okay Best

coverageas money as goodsThe signal reach could be betteroverall is okProductClass product from TPLink A worthy investment,Non returnable so now using this as it is Bandwidth control is a must for this price range Model was archer c80Great delivery from amaozn  It was easy to setup as a extender  Signal is also good but not that great It can cover 1 flat well  Signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs Overall great purchase Must buyNeed little better customer supportgoodI expected much stronger signal 10 meter away Its okay working but not as expectedtp link is good productGood productDecided on buying this Router from TPLink after days of research reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different modelsWas on a 20 Mbps connection with a Netgear N300 router since 2016 which used to suffice for moderate usage till now However with increase in the number of devices like Smart TV 2 iPads and a laptop etc it necessitated an upgrade Also considering the current workfromhome scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well the internet usage was being stretched to its limit and the trusted Netgear router simply couldnt match up to the increased bandwidth demandTo capitalise on the current situation our current ISP came out with interesting Fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection That in turn needed a new router to utilize its optimum potential Finally zeroed in on the TPLink Archer C80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers Was also tempted to buy the AX1500 considering theres barely any price difference but then came across a few reviews which stated that Wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devicesOrder delivered by Amazon within a day Full marks for the seamless delivery as always Prime has truly been a boonInstalled the Router today Installation via Tether App was seamless ISP guy helped with the PPPOE signin process and released the MAC ID which was bound to our old Router The whole process was done in 10 mins and we were onlineThe dual bands are truly a boon Have divided the devices at home equally between 24G and 5G as per usage As the router is close to the TV unit have connected it to 5G and also alternatively connected via the Ethernet cable just in caseSpeed testsStarted off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5G Played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connectedHave attached a few pictures for reference Sitting near the Router 5G Download speed is 77 mbps and Upload is 754 mbps 5G speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between Download 724 mbps and Upload 749 mbps 24G speed in the same room as the Router is Download 683 mbps and Upload 792 mbps This is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 5055 mbps will be the threshold for 24G Used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old N300 Speed Test via the Ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the TV Download 78 mbps and Upload 75 mbpsCouldnt have asked for more really This seems to be totally idealBuild quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job however would have preferred that they were placed like other TPLink models like the Archer A6 so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directionsThe LED lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough Maybe Im used to the prominent lights on my old Router These are a blinkandmiss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case theres an issue One big element missing in this device is a USB port which is absolutely essential in todays age and expected to be included for this price range Wonder whats the reason behind giving it a missI have sealed the extra LAN ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture Its a good practice The outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish however Im a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portionFunctionally though this seems to be a real good offering from TPLink Hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days Allinall seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years considering an internet plan upgrade if anyHope I touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice This product is RECOMMENDED

Works with two devicesPositive review Almost good and usefulHissing sound  output from viSe TV Vijay salesAcceptable sound no hassle of chargingExcellent productNot good rangeVery good,Atlast  I connected successfully Working good But sound volume  clarity not adequate Durability to be assessed  Dear amazonin tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearlyManual printing also is bad I had to struggleDoes what it says Works well to connect two Bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop smart TV etc Can take a bit of time to pair two devices But the manual in the box helpsSound quality over aux cable too is good So even if you do not have a digital output or RCA you can still use it Bit bit flimsy and delicate But then you dont need to move it around everydayDisadvantage  the sound and video lag with distance while connecting Bluetooth with headphonesPairing with headphones difficult need to wait longFeels volumes lowI got this to addon to a highend system which traditionally doesnt have the facility However its often requested when guests come over I was using a Phoenix transreceiver but the constant need of charging and the single indicator LED made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application The optical out is connected to a dual ESS9028 DAC and the device used for transmission is the iPad AirThis lacks a battery which is a big differentiator This means it is not exactly portable and the form factor reinforces that feature It is intended to be a desktop unit and it comes with a reasonable set of cables The quality of the included cables is quite poor so its best to use something elseCompared to the direct input from USB the overall sound is poorer with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble Still this is being used in a highend system  I suspect with many lesser speakerampDACs it will be acceptable At maximum output the level is about 12dB lower than a direct USB connection to the DACIt is around the same as my Signature Acoustics unit which is 13rd the size but uses a battery and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature or the nice display which is handy if you are close byThe bypass is one of the highlights of this device it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough and allows you to use both BT and another optical sourcereceiver  though only either can be used at a timeThe build quality is average It is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards hence the thin cables supplied The onboard volume control is nice if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume I use the DAC remote It also has only 16 clicks so the control will be very coarse The display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low it is sufficient for the tasksOverall its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices The sound quality limitations of BT transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols so Id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an addon for a hifi

than 1 yearOverall its a good product very usefulSome minor drawbacksGreat for vacuum bad for moppingGood productProduct service issuesGood productA helping hand for working women,My review of using new Vacuum Mop Pro 2 for 3 days1 The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals They dont mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup for the app and robot  to work together This tip is missing in user manual2 WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range 5GHz connection does not work with this model3 The robot takes anywhere between 4060 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq ft house Battery life is really good in the new model 50 or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house Charging is also not bad It took 15 hrs for it to charge full 100 the first time4 Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times it would not repeat this behavior5 Dusting is of A1 quality Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering We never knew we had so much dust in our house6 Mopping is average I would call it light wiping and not mopping Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps7 Vacuum  Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness In this mode mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick upI recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles8 Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house This is not ideal So its important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping9 The mop works horribly on door mats main door or bathroom mats It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place So please remove all the mats esp during mopping session10 Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode Sometimes we dont even know where it has gone it gets so quietPros Battery life Suction power Noise levels VacuumingCons Mopping is average Its at best can be called as light wiping Setup is bit tricky user manual is insufficient Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home You have to figure it out using YouTube videos I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing Once the device is confused it doesnt correct itself automatically It needs a map reset Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before moppingSuch tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your ownBut I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house cleanProsFor cleaning dust it is very good we can set daily scheduleeven if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule cleaning the box after its work is also not  very hecticbrushes are providingWe can set restricted areasConesMost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush little difficult to clear the brushIt has been more than 1 year iam using thisOne time the movement is low when icheckedso many hairs are stucked in its wheelit was little  difficult to clear the hair strandsMopping it is average onlyonly takes very little amount of waterso oily things will remain in the flooronce or twice  in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizolIt cant reach the sharp corners alsoOnce we create restricted areaby the time of using it couldnt detect the proper area we markedso it enter those area and get stuck most of the timesit is main thing I hate about this productremaining things are okaythen we have to reset the map and set restricted area againit is bit annoyingOverall it is very good for memy brooming is almost completely replaced by this once in week I do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didnt covered by this machine In all other aspect like price batteryapp feature suction and cleaning its really very good productI find it very useful and nice to have productSo will directly make note of  some drawbacksimprovent area i observed1 Sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle2 Its little noisy or I will say not a silent thing in standard suction power though that with any vaccuum cleaner3 Xiaomi could have provides extra Hepa filter with it4 vaccummop doesnt clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush so I do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option5 Charging is super slow if compared with any 5200mAh battery with mobile fast charger its 10 times slower despite such a big docking chargerI am a bachelor and i do not like Maid coming to my housethis solves the purpose It is great at vacuuming my 2000 Sqft house It can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life It collects way more dust than the manual broomingIt can skip corners and narrow places Once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on55 for navigation and room mappingMopping is equally bad Mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor Also water tank broke in just few cleaningsRecommended for vacuuming purposeVery good product Very helpful product in my homeWe purchased the product in April and now it is not workingAfter charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stoppedEasy to use and Working well little bit of noise is there but acceptableHelping hand More reliable than maids Does the job well Once in 4 days you need to mop yourself Good suction

for moneyPrice could be lesserIdeal for new MacBooksAverage and overpricedMeet the expectationsSo I got the product on 11th August 2022 This is the initial impression of the productOk ok product,Used for more than a month Works HDMI USB well so far Not tested the MicroSD slotsBuild quality is great Im using this with my MacBook it works fine  While using this adapter Amazon prime videos cant play in 1080p resolution on monitor it says the devices not support hd  Other ports are working fine not a problemI took this for my macbook m2 pro 2022 edition and it is working perfectlyall the ports are working fine till now its been 2 month i am using it  length of the wire is little small it could be little big and the price is also little high it could be under 900rs then it will justifyIf you bought a MacBook Air or Pro recently and wondering what to do about all the missing ports  USB HDMI etc this is your one stop solutionI tried on my MacBook Air M2 and it works like a charm I connected various pen drives disk drives and a 128 go flash drive  all worked fineVery reasonably priced compared to other options yet has a fairly good look and feelEverything working fine but it doesnt works with Macbooks HDMI when try to connect one plus TV as an extended screen different displays on both but works fine if used as second screen with common displaySolved my problemI got the product on 11th August 2022 This is the initial impression1 Packaging  The package I received was in good condition it had a pre wrapped plastic on the box No complaint about packaging but one thing to note is that No Brand name on the packaging Although when you open the product  the brand name is there on the product2 Build  Wire length is small to my opinion It has a metal build finish and looks premium and sturdy Wire quality is also good but at this price should have provided braided cable3 I have tested this product with 3 usb ports connected  a Mouse b Keyboard cExternal 2TB SSD SSD does not get disconnected when all 3 usb are connected For confirmation i did a 2 gb file transfer and No disconnections were noticedNote  The Speed of the data transfer is low I did 2 gb file transfer and was getting the max speed of  39MBs with the SSD connected through the usb hubAlthough when I did the same file transfer by directly connecting the SSD to the laptop port i got speed of 111 MBs So if you want to do lot of file transfer better connect it directly and not through the usb hubSo far initial impression are good let see how long it lastSometimes not detected by MAC and quality is not that good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41qTZXl3KaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Verilux%C2%AE-Multiport-Adapter-Portable-Compatible/dp/B09163Q5CD/ref=sr_1_284?qid=1672903008&s=computers&sr=1-284,BAIXA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BAIXA

usageGood product and received latest V4Good Budget Gigabit Router with Beamforming and multiple options in firmwareRange is issue for 5g every whereValue For MoneyGo for itSuper Signal support install,I really liked this router for a smallish space The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistentHowever it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is Its the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a years usage And to make it worse theres dismal after sales serviceI tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasnt stable I think Ill finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers Hopefully Ill find a good maker Good RouterAfter researching lot I settled on TP link A6I was looking for better range router this Router really worth the price Dual band guest wifi I upgraded from tenda n301 and performance is really goodRange for 5Gz is not that good as 25Gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than thisI was using Tenda AC 10 router since 2019 for 100Mbps connection from Local ISP Mach1 Broadband Mumbai Most of devices 5 Mobiles 4 Laptops 1 Firestick at my home work on 5Ghz except 1 CCTV camera Range of Tenda AC 10 was good and used Digisol AC750 repeater for farthest room of my 2 BHK homeIn recent lightning strike in Mumbai power adapter of Tenda AC10 got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter I was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget I tried 2 routers Mercusys AC1900 MR50G  TP Archer C80 AC1900 before this Both Routers didnt meet my expectation Range and speed of these 2 routers were poor than my earlier Tenda AC10 Amazon accepted returns without a single question Thumbs up to AmazonAfter some more research I zeroed on TP link Archer A6  C6 As per comparison on TP link website both are identical routers After doing some more research on blogs and reviews I found that Archer A6 is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from Qualcomm Hence purchased Archer A6 Feature of Onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future Separate Wifi SSID with same strength on both 24  5 Ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser as per TP link support page this is dedicated wifi link for Onemesh repeatersNow for router Router is same as Tenda AC10 for coverage it can not cover farthest room in 2BHK on 5Ghz 24 Ghz band can cover 2BHK house but speed is around 30 Mbps on 100 Mbps plan However speed on Archer A6 is better that Tenda AC10 Im getting 90 Mbps upload and download consistently on devices 515 feet apart in 5Ghz TP Link Archer A6 is better than costlier AC1900 routers Just for info I received US version v2 of router instead of EU version mentioned on TP Link India website Hence firmware on TP Link India website will not match with device firmware However this device has auto update option directly from Internet Also router can be managed by TPLink Tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using TP link account on both router and Tether appBy trying so many routers i understood that 5Ghz range will be week even with costliest router Instead of using Digisol AC750 repeater i installed my old Tenda AC10 in repeater mode for 5Ghz 24 Ghz disabled Now my complete home is covered by 5Ghz signal In the farthest room i receive download  upload speed of around 75 MbpsI also tried old TP link Archer C50 which i had purchased when abroad performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks Gigabit ports Beamforming  MUMIMOMy ISP has connected my link on Gigabit port of their switch in my society However cabling is only 2 pair CAT 5e which supports max 100 Mbps full duplex I will try to get cabling changed to either 4 Pair CAT 5E or CAT6 from ISP and check the performance I will update review after cabling changeSo in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with Gigabit ports Beamforming  MUMIMO even if your internet speed is less than 100Mbps as it is future proof TP Lnk Archer A6 is good router meeting all requirement within the budgetHope this review is useful in search of good futureproof routerEdit 1My ISP tried to replace my connection to FTTH and this router was connected to Fiber ONU using Gigabit Port It worked only for 15 mins Max speed was 230 Mbps ISP was not able to resolve the FTTH issue and changed cable to 4 Pair CAT5e which supports Gigabit transmission Now net speed is around 160 Mbps My internet plan is 100 Mbps Im happy with the speed I have asked ISP to change my connection to FTTH at last Tenda AC10 is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of Archer A6 using CAT5e cable Now complete home received stable wifi of 160 Mbps on 5Ghz bandI will update once again when FTTH connection is successfulGood product till now 1 monthI am very SatisfiedI am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and I used to reconnect it and the same way VPN  is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting Now I am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well Finally i am

my gas stove Induction sucks Great valueNo1    Good,I recvd product within 3 dys while owing to rural area other product tks 10 dys to deliver n product recvd at gd condition n works well aftr use if smthng cms up will review againIt works good Nice heating But hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges Other than that fine product2500 se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha Use karne mein bahut achha haiOver all Im really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience I was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature This product has only like 8 temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle For example when I set 160C then it is burning toasts and onions When I set one step lower it is 130C and it is not enough for frying Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside  The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so Im sure the fault is in this philips stove You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed  And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside Im really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stoveThere is one positive side and that is that heating is quick My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly Faster than on gas stove Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenientControll is easy But I hate details First I love one detail There is pause button which is very cool If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat  It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off light up again and then find right flame again Here you just press pause again and cook as before But that is only thing that I love Otherwise I hate how it is designed First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless Those buttons are preset temperatures But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook Like there is stirr fry button and it set 180C It totally burns onion I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C But even 160C is too much burning But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set  Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and offBut back to controll Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it wont let you or let you to do only one  but not 2 times  Why I dont know probably ill will You need to first press manual button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press  and set your desired temperature So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press manual and  to set my temperatureAnother control is setting time I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it but how it is implemented I hate When you press time button then by default it set 30 minutes Ok but when you hold  button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to 0 and roll to 3 hours Holding incrementdecrement is so quick that it is useless It must have implement some idiot Anyway you can always click one by one So to set 10 minutes you must click time button and then click 20 times minus button to set 10 minutes It is doable but pretty annoying Or I long press  it usially jumps directly to 3 hours and then I press 11 times   Still anoying but I save like 8 clicks What is super idiotic is that when I want to add 5 minutes I click time and it by default set 30 minutes again  Arrrrggghhhhh So instead of just click time and 5 times  I need to click 25 times   Really this must have done some idiot Another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not Imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like 3 seconds and not pressing  and then after those 3 seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again When controlling  stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry So over all I would buy anything else next time Maybe it will be worse but I would at least tryAnyway to say something positive at the end I like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good Packaging was also well But power cable is only like 12 meters That might be too short But for me just enough Also I like mechanic buttons some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but I like to feel the press and the click Buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them Cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat  Cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stoveProduct is good but service center problem not available nearlyNo1    Ordered 3 one was faulty,Ausente,Ausente,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,ALTA

heatingJust go for itBest for instant heat waterAmazing productsInstant got water quite literally,I bought Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 45KW WhiteBlue and Im really happy I made this decisionLet me start with why I went for Instant Geyser instead of Storage GeyserStorage geysers have a tank to store water and heat itFor example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the waterAs it has to heat high volume 10 lts of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutesInstant geysers on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutesHowever the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volumedepending on tank capacity of hot waterNow who should opt for Instant Geyser and who should opt for Storage Geyser is the question  If you like to have a Shower Bath for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for Storage Geyser since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pausesInstead if we consider Instant Geyser of 3lts capacity for shower bath it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water againHence for a shower bath better to go for Storage GeysersIf you like to have a Bathtub Bath then instant geysers are good to go becauseConsider using a bathtub a bathtub generally is of capacity 350ltsIf you even use a Storage Geyser of high capacity as much as 25lts still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes eachBecause at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 510mins for the next 25lts to heatSo to fill the entire bath tub you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water  350ltsSo the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins on an average  98minsIn this scenario of Bathtub bath its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small youll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heathotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for Bucket Bath Both Storage geysers of 15lts or above and Instant geysers of 3lts or above are good to goJust choose based on  Price  Time taken to heat  instant takes less time   Energy consumption  instant comsumes less Now coming to Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 45KW why I bought this Havells is a great brandI wanted to have it for Bathtub Bath45KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this productI have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds  I have used a timer to note that The installation was totally free however remember you will be charged if there is any Plumbing Work do be doneNo need to buy any extra accesories like pipes everything is provided in the box you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rsAs soon as the product was delivered by amazon I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done thanks a lot Havells  This might differ for you based on your location I live in hyderabadI really like havells customer serviceThe geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tankIt has Auto Cutoff feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off  however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats It shows color indication Blue when its heating and Orange when it has done heating  Have a look at the pictures I have attachedNoteGo for the 45kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of waterMake sure it is 45kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the Mustard colored geyser is not 45kw but 3kw  better go for white and blue color to be sure Very nice productGood product45KW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water Good productGreat product at great priceValue for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2minHavella water heaterWater heats up in 4560 secs depending on the weatherThis review is after using this water heater continuously for 1012 days in December in Kolkata with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 1415 degree Celsius during afternoon early evening hours On the coldest day so far it took around 1min 1015seconds to heat up completelyIf you dont have chronic pain or arthritis or this is not going to be used for very old people whereby really hot water is required for bathing I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 910 degrees because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower not using a bucket and its manageableObviously cant be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser but this heats quite quickly so can be used in the shower even with the low capacityFor that same reason it can be used for multiple people because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters youll have fully hot water only of lesser quantity so if you dont live someplace cold or dont need very hot water but mildly hot water this can be used for multiple people as wellInstallation support was also goodNo cons only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 45kW range then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesnt have their own home and might need to move around because its compact and provides instant hot water,Ausente,Ausente,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,BAIXA

at the lowest price and it is not bad at allGood Bluetooth ProjectorWhat more can you ask for at this priceGood for winter nightsNice purchaseValue for moneyWORTH EVERY PENNY SPENTValue for money,This review is for the native FHD projectorYes it is a native 1080p led projector connected this to my desktop computer and tested also Dont bother trying to play videos from USB Quality is badBut when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi it is actually quite good I mean picture quality colours brightness etc for a sub 10k projector In this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub 15k rangesSound is also pretty much okay loud enough more like boat 5w speakers may be a bit more louder not good quality wise Quitr workable as portable solution but not for a permanent setupAudio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also Meaning 21 speakers can be connected to it for a higher setup person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itselfFrom 9ft and 34 inches distance of lens to wall we can get exactly 100 inch87 inch x 49 inch projection So it can be called as short throw projector albiet may be border level There is an option to reduce the screen size upto 75 of original size electronically once connected to HDMIKeystone correction is not usuable at all That wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screenThat means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location Can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction I e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels projector also has to fixed at lower levels only Best focus can be get when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably 5 to 6 inch above so if we flip the projector upside down we get best focus opposite to center a few inches downFor mysetup where projecting only 15 feet above from the floor going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down this way i can fix the projector a bit more abovebehind the sofa I will post the pics later once it is setup properlyNow the verdict  this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand is one of most vfm combo for approx 11k for experiencing a very bright 100 inch screen experience of good quality for 1 or 2 person  But now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of 15k to 30k im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projectorlook only ANSI value This buy was more of an impulse purchase but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projectorEdit the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel which impacts the clarity also after a few days I had to clean the panel myselg just after 15 month  New lesson learnt apart from high ansi lumen projector this is also an important factor for future purchase Planning to get a custom cloth cover made so that i dont have to clean it often Though Lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model Somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet Only the lcd has very very fine dust particles insideQuality is good value for Money Bluetooth Connectivity is smooth and fast The sound quality of the Projector is not so great but that we had already considered before Hotstar App really works nicely with great quality and so does Youtube Netflix  Prime video doesnt give the same quality initially but that must be wifi connection Some apps however dont get installed or just close on their ownThe good point is the Bluetooth connection and even we have added a Bluetooth soundbar so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good optionThis is indeed a fantastic product in this price rangeit is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through HDMIneedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day ie if you can cover up your windows and other light sourcesScreen spread is Almost up to 120 inch at a throw distance of 13 to 1 feet with the sharpness more or less intactconverts 4K to 1080PWill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mineensure that the walls are white for best image  video reproductionDefinitely recommended at this price pointConsOnly vertical Keystone correction availableProjector is good so far as it used for last 3 days May revisit the feedback after a couple of monthsI bought this projector for my classroom and its very helpful for their studies Now students connect themselves more to the worldI feel Its a value for money product as I have already used it for last two monthsIf u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further THIS IS IT BEST IN PRICE GOOD PICTURE QUALITY BRIGHTNESS AND A DECENT REMOTE WITH GOOD FUNCTIONALITY As always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs Very good for family get together movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity Ive canceled my dth connection Coz AMAZON PRIME TV STICK WITH THIS PROJECTOR IS ALL I NEED THATS ALL THE TIME I HAVE FOR WATCHING TV AMIDST MY WORK AND THEY DO THE JOB WELL An entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied Any queries ping me Ill help u as much as i can Dont worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family manit will satisfy all ur needsbe it surfing movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too Hope it helpsUPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS  4HRSDAY USAGE The pic uploaded was by noon 1pm with dark screensHI THIS WAS A REPLY TO A CUSTOMER TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN EGATE I9 N UC 68  46  BUT I THOUGHT IF THIS WAS PUT UP IN UPDATE SECTION A LOT WOULD BENEFIT SO HERE IT GOESFirst u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if its for offic use or home entertainment also u didnt mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc since u have not ill go with a general review for purposes ITS GOING TO BE A VERY DETAILED REVIEW SO GUYS WITH OUT PATIENCE CAN RUN TO THE END AT ONCEI too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i9 from uc 68  46 Let me tell u what helped me decideFirst n foremost egate is an Indian company unlike uc which is a common Chinese product with a namesake brand UC confirmed it with my friend in China Hence service n general trust is more on egate than competitionSecondly from fellow customers Ive learnt that egate is brighter than the rest twoThirdly the images are sharp and theres no blur on text on egate compared to the other two Just learn to adjust the keystone properlyFourth the length of the power cord is longer in egateFifth its got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use The others dont have itNow in general Ive not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users so Im gonna tell u wat Ive done n wat else u can do with egateIve placed it at a length of 15 feet from the screen n it gives awesome display Connect a 21 51 home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at 23 feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping aroundIve connected my SECOND FIRE TV Stick with it so it connects to WiFi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n FF Also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etcU get a remote which functions well along with itMOST IMPORTANTLY U CAN CEILING MOUNT IT OR TRIPOD IT TOO WHICH THE OTHER TWO CANT BUT remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by 180 in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod its not necessaryAlso u can place the projector behind the screen LIKE AN ACTUAL THEATRE IF U R USING A CLOTH SCREEN LIKE ME N CONSTRAINT OF SPACE BUT REMEMBER TO FLIP THE IMAGE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IN SETTINGS AS THE PROJECTOR IS BEHIND THE SCREEN N U NEED TO GET A 90 FLIPPED IMAGE FROM BEHINDso I guess its the 3d part that made ur decision murky wat I would love to say for that is Ive a Samsung 3d enabled smart tv n Ive seen the output of these kind of cheap 3d devices too since its a low cost projector 3d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a TV if 3d is a priority as in TV the 3d effects r awesome But nowadays u can install an APP IN ANY DEVICE to watch 3d movies or better download a 3d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur 3d glasses My friends do it but I DONTVERDICT  BEST PROJECTOR IN MARKET IN MY OPINION FOR THE PRICE AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSENOTE  FOR AMAZON PRIME N NETFLIX USERS IF U R USING A 21 AUDIO OUTPUT SOMETIMES U MIGHT NOT GET AUDIO SO DONT GET WORRIED N ITS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROJECTOR ITS JUST THAT THE LATEST MOVIES ARE MADE WITH DOLBY 51 SOUND SO JUST USE THE ON SCREEN SETTING IN THE VIDEO TO NAVIGATE TO SOUND N CHOOSE STEREO FROM THE DEFAULT DOLBY OPTION  VOILA U R DONEHOPE IT HELPS PING ME FOR ANY DOUBTSHIT LIKE IF MY REVIEW WAS USEFULAs per money its bestBut if you are fan of pictures qualityThink about

average mouseGood for daily useMouse is too small in size to use and getting painMust buy this for normal useNoisy and not ErgonomicGreat ProductWell suited for ordinary and official usageNice Product,EDIT This doesnt change my review actually it probably makes it lean even heavier towards the 4 star than 3 star rating but I actually sat on the keyboard while it was on my chair Im an absolute unit of a dude weighing 120kg and the keyboard wasnt affected at all Im genuinely surprisedFirst of all Id give this a 355 instead of the 4 but I rounded it up instead of down because theres more to like than dislikeProduct was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape When I unpacked it the keyboard had three missing keys iirc it was left Alt Z and the Windows keys I turned over the box and dumped everything and voila The missing keys fell out Not off to a great start but I slapped those keys on which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy and plugged in the receiver to my laptop No setup or 3rd party software necessary it just started working instantly Pretty seamlessI only use the keyboard when I connect my laptop to my TV and Im sitting at a distance I use my laptops keyboard otherwise I absolutely love the keyboard I was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent Its not super premium but its much better than what I was expecting for the price It has flip stands on the back to raise it and an onoff switch if you want to conserve battery The keys themselves are full sized and as someone with larger hands I really appreciate it The curve around the space bar looks cool but I dont think it adds anything ergonomically The typing experience is nice the keys have enough feedback to them not mechanical levels obviously but still satisfying enough The Caps Lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and dont accidentally hit it while typing neat little addition The shortcutmedia keys on top all work fine with Windows 11 Theres not much else to say about the keyboard It should be more than sufficient for everyday officebrowsingschool tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot Do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard I was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget thats understandable and acceptable Overall I very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you payThe mouse on the other hand no pun intended is mediocre at best The build quality is not good it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning like its gonna fall apart at any time The mouse also starts lagging randomly The lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance Also it just doesnt feel good in your palm I have an Amazon Basics mouse that I purchased while I was in the US for 7 520rs and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this It also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of useAs an overall package I would say its decent for the price There are lots of other sets in this price range and I picked this literally because of the Logitech branding since I own a few other Logitech products and enjoy them a lot The keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying its mouse friend I hope they improve the mouse going forward because then this would be the best combo in this range As it stands right now its fairly indistinguishable from its competitorsRecommended for  people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lotNot recommended for  gaming or any form of power users It might work for single player games like city builders grand strategy RTSes etc but I would not recommend it for any form of shooters especially online The mouse simply isnt up to taskThe Keyboard is good and working nice for me the Mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only it will be good if the mouse is in regular size Also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settingsI using this product since one year not any problem foundEven battery cell not changeI dont really know if its worth the cost or not But I mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks Ergonomic is also a must as I use these for long hoursCurrently I use logitech m590 mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at allGreat ProductI have been using this product for 2years Its battery is great still running The keys could get hard with time therefore i had to use WD40 to lubricate them After 2years some random keys have stopped working such Del Semicolon Numpad3 The mouses right click isnt functioning anymore The left click has irritating double click issue So not suited for FPS games Speed and connection is adequate no lag noticed The keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it Ergonomics are great no issue with that If youre looking for a longer size keyboard for approx 2years of proper functioning for daily or official use then it is a good purchase Mouse is small and comfortable even for left handed people Keep in mind the keys WILL become stiff over timeI purchased it for my personal use  which includes mostly working it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse  I have not faced any issue with it I have not tested its performanace,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41X6hey-ExL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-Wireless-mk270r-Keyboard-Mouse/dp/B00CEQEGPI/ref=sr_1_268?qid=1672903008&s=computers&sr=1-268,ALTA,RUIM,RUIM,RUIM,BOM,ALTA

assistant I could plug in Fire TVMi TV box and get those features later on Delivery was pretty hassle free the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages Samsung technicians came in a few hours later installed and gave a demoSoundPer other reviews  sound from speakers is apparently bad but in my case I found it satisfactory I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room and the TVs speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via BluetoothPictureThe Panels great but nothing worth raving about Gray uniformity isnt greatie gray tones wont be perfectly uniform across the whole panel therell be darker zones towards the edgescorners based on backlight placement Blacks arent perfectly black  and theyre brighter than youd expect from a VA panel but this isnt noticeable at all when the room is lit No backlight bleed Colors are as good as Id like them to be and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste even when brightness is turned down to 40 720p content is watchable from 8ft 1080p is goodId say better than I expected and 4K is well 4KConnectivityI have a 35 Mbs broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available without stutters The TV has Bluetooth 50 and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fineI use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330  theres no noticeable latency and volume can be controlled through the remote itselfApps  FeaturesHas all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed  Netflix Hotstar Prime Apple TV  YouTube All of them stream 4k content except for Hotstar  which only streamed 4K a few times 1080p is still very watchable and not really a deal breaker No Dolby Vision support  which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99 of budget TVs in the market cant produce the contrast youd expect out of DV content anyways so why care You get HDR and HDR content is definitely better looking than nonHDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy I planned to use the TV without cable but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV Bloomberg 9XM etc these stream in 1080p so a great bonus to haveRemoteVery basic RF remote unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs The remotes looks pretty sleek and stylish but thats about it Biggest gripe  typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind youll need to use the Dpad to navigate on an onscreen keyboard You can control the TV using Samsungs SmartThings App but guess what  you cant even use your phones keyboard to type in when controlling through the app  this is something that can be added through an update but its not there yetAttached pictures are all of 4K content Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review but you can still get an idea of the TVs designlooks Panel colors and contrast etcId say Im really happy  and given the chance wouldnt change my decision Its a Samsung TV so end of the day if it produces a decent picture and lasts a couple of years more than I expect I can overlook all other cons Id highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TVPlaced order on

length cable  go for original from oneplus showroomInitial review written just after purchaseYes it supports dash charge and no heating issues Using it since 3 daysOne NEGATIVE point is short length It is 1 meter long  Original cable is 15 meters So it is difficult to use my phone while chargingOther NEGATIVE point I can figure out is that cable is really hard In my experience hard cables break more often than soft pliable ones It is not easy to put a hard cable in my bag without putting strain on it for daily commute to office this makes them to break easily before timeHard cables are also not easy to use when the mobile is charging It puts strain on both the points the charger side and mobile side which again makes it vulnerable to cracksThis raises a question on longevity of the cableLets do some calculationsMy original OnePlus cable lasted for 2 years cost of which at present is Rs1100 it was soft easy to bend and keep in my bag while traveling daily for work The Rs1100 cable online is 15 meters long which makes it easy to work on phone while it is pluggedPopio cable costs Rs400 at present but they show it 999  which means price may rise  So even if it lasts for 68 months it will be more costly to me than an original cable in 2 years Popio cable is 1 meter long against 15 meters of original cable So effective price of popio cable is Rs500 for 15 meter cablePopio cable is 1 meters long against 15 meters of original cable Which makes it not easy to use the phone while it is charging Using a short cable while charging puts strain on the cable and phones charging port which is damaging for both and also decreases life of both the cable and charging portThey say you have to consider cost while writing review But you should also consider cost on long run not just the immediate cost So if u are thinking of changing your phone in coming future and dont want to spend too much on cable Popio is the best option availableBut if you are looking for a long term solution and you can afford to buy Rs1100 cable I will suggest to go for the original one It has more length it is soft and it lasts longer with moderate useI ordered this cable for 330 in the sale

productGoodVivid picture quality is stunningSUPER DEALValue for moneyVery nice,NOTE If you select brandauthorized TV installation then DO NOT unbox the tv until MI representative arrivesThis ensures that if TV is damaged in transportation then you will get replacement easily If you didnt choose installation then just SHOOT the video of unboxing by yourself to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed Amazon Prime and Netflix are not inbuilt but can be Sideloaded  To use your Set top box with android interface you need to buy MI IR cable and set it up OR else directly connect the set up box via AV or HDMI port to use it conventionally Out of 8GB memory you only get around 47GB free to use check the image attachedThere are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube but NONE explains the TVs potential completely and what its actual flaws are Heres a quick Fact for the Users complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees  here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K So just check once what options you have before complainingEventually I bought this TV since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks I am stating my DETAILED user experience Its a detailed  huge review but do read it if you want to invest this much amount If you want to get quick overview of the device then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review  Firstly its budget friendly  ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market Has Most number of Output port  1AV 3HDMI 2USB  Has Android 81 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth Has Dual interface  MI Patchwall  Android TV  I mostly prefer android TV interface  Remote has Bluetooth  Voice Search with sleek profile Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM  8GB storage  47GB actual  Speaker Output is low Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface Amazon prime  Netflix is NOT preloaded but can be side loaded Native Display is ONLY HD though 1080p  even 4K videos from youtube works well check images attached Can install  play tons of High quality games like RR3 etc check images attached Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the timeFULL DETAILED REVIEW BUILT QUALITY  Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body Its not great but above average Table top stands looks bit flimsy but are workable The screws which are provided in the box DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly so I bought new from local store It has averagely slim profile not the slimmest in the market Speaker Placement is inconvenient Since they are placed at the bottom so when you keep it on table top the sound tends to dampen and bulge Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up Overall built quality is above averageDISPLAY QUALITY  It has very Thin bezels which looks great Video resolution is 1366x768p but 1080p videos works fine on it 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well Viewing angle are good compared to price  Check the images attached  Contrast is above average Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid Display quality is also above average not very greatREMOTE CONTROL  Its very sleek and compact Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate Fortunately it has Volume buttons which is handy  I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume P  Placement of Voice search button is improper Its just below Power button and I end up pressing power button a lot Finally its bluetooth so no need to point it towards tv for operationOTHER FEATURES  It has Dual interface ie Patchwall and android TV  Has tons of content Many games can be installed till you have memory left including multiplayer games Google voice search is very useful if you dont want to use keyboard Processing speed is fast and I havent detected any lags yet  Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed not due to hardware  Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectlyCONS  Speaker output though rated 20W is NOT upto the mark My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound Placement of speaker is inconvenient as in table top position speakers face the table and sound dampens Internal Memory is very LESS NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded though you can side load them Miracast not supported Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes Native resolution is just 720p HD though the 1080p videos works on usb  4K on youtube Screen is Slightly reflective its similar to almost all the other LED tvs Mixed experiences of after sales serviceCUSTOMER CARE  Firstly the installation is a Joke My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is theres ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product P Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative so theres NO point of return window time frame MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpfulVERDICT Considering all the facts if you are fine with above average Display quality want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget then this the TV you should certainly go for Trust me you wont get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months If you have higher budget then certainly explore brands like sony samsung etcThis is NOT a perfect smart TV but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty its NO brainer to choose this its certainly worth the investmentThis television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of 12500Performance The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media supportPicture Quality Many people complain about the overbright screen But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settingsThese are my preferred settingsBacklight 1 to 20During night even the lowest value of 1 is  bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyesDuring day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions A maximum of 20 would be enoughSetting backlight to minimum improves black levels reduces power consumption increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during nightBrightness 48Brightness setting controls black levelIncreasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrastBrightness at 50 pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationAt 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of detailsContrast  40 to 45Contrast setting controls white levelContrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45 Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed As the screen itself is very bright increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrastSaturation 45 to 50Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50 At 45 colors look more natural At 50 colors looks a bit punchy But still its a personal preferenceAt the above settings the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p  The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TVLG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black DemoLG OLED Eclipse 2 DemoLG HD Demo Art NouveauFull HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named Life Untouched and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good detailsScreen Quality I think this is a VA panel  the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels The screen is glossy and hence reflective This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing itLike all other LCD panels this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but thats only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds While watching movies or other content its not at all a problem Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etcLuckily theres no backlight bleeding in the unit  I receivedViewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but thats a common VA panel characteristic IPS panels with good viewing angles cant be expected at this price pointAll LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels VA panels excels in black depth despite its average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levelsSound Quality Bass is a bit weak I think bass is improved following some updates So giving 5 stars from 4 Its very loud even at low volume Midrange and treble are very good Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearlyEditIn a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good But it isnt100Hz  7300Hz  81000Hz  43500 Hz  610000 Hz  5A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffledThe following settings sounds much better and heres the reason100 Hz  8  BassFrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick DrumToms Snare etc300 Hz  4  Low MidrangeEnhances bass and depth of male vocals Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 Hz  3  MidrangeImparts a metallic tone Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant3500 Hz  5  Upper MidrangeVocals especially female sounds best at this frequency A value of 5 enhances vocal quality Increasing too much makes vocals harsh10000 Hz  7 TrebleAdds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments Enhances tinkling  sounds of metallic  instrumentsHuman ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here its 1000 and 3500 Hz Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue Even increasing 300Hz is disturbingGreat sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget But considering its midrange frequency clear treble and loudness it deserves 4 starsRemote Control Minimalism is great But minimalism with less functionality is not so great Addition ofMuteTV Settings and Video input selection buttons would ve made the remote more functionalApp support UpdateWhen the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime Now the TV deserves 5 stars for app supportPros and Cons Pros1 Powerful processor for 4K media playback2 App installation via USB3 Built in Chromecast4 Bluetooth remote5 Voice CommandCons UpdatePreviously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby optionBut in the latest update both these issues are solvedNow when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input sourceTo enable it go to Settngs Inputs  Enable Stay on the previous source optionScreen off feature is also added in the new update Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off optionThe only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast But on a latest update build PI4316 miracast is included and now its perfectTo sum upOverall considering the picture quality powerful hardware and the price the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of its average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across IndiaNew brands like iFFalcon Blaupunkt Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price But when it comes to service centres its a dead endI am very much satisfied with the purchaseIts good productGoodif you like a best tv on your budget Ill recommend you this stunning picture quality and DTS surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and Miracast is not good Build quality goodsound and bass excellentProduct is very good Sound quality is crisp Worth buying I brought it 2 years back Still working fineGood
